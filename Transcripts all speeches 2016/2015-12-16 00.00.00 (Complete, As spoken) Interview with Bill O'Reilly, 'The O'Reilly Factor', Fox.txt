BILL O'REILLY: So last night, I want you to think back to when Bush was calling you a chaotic guy. And you struck back in your own inimitable way and said he was a loser and you were trouncing him in the polls.

Do you feel bad when you're doing that?

DONALD TRUMP: Look, he's doing very badly. He's got a very, very low number. I mean I don't even know if he can continue forward. He spends like $50 million. I've spent nothing. And I mean even behind me I have 15,000 people that showed up on a very short notice.

I mean there's something going on. But Bush is a, you know, look, he's a person who has just not been able to carry it forward. People -- if he has a rally you have what, 20 people show up for his rallies. So it's not working. And what he did --

BILL O'REILLY: More than that.

DONALD TRUMP: -- I mean I don't blame him. Bill, I don't blame him. He's got to do something because obviously, if he's got 2 in the poll or 3 in the poll, he's got to be doing something.

BILL O'REILLY: OK, but do you feel --

DONALD TRUMP: So I don't really blame him.

BILL O'REILLY: Do you feel badly when you're saying, look, you're a loser, you're going down the stage and you'll -- you'll probably be off the stage next time? People want to know how you feel when you say stuff like that.

DONALD TRUMP: I don't like doing it. I don't like saying bad things about Jeb Bush. I feel a little bit sorry for him, to be honest with you. And I don't like saying bad things about him.

But you have to understand, he struck first. I mean, you know, it was all staged up. Some guy wrote it for him. And he, you know, came out and right from day one, right from minute one, he came out and he attacked.

BILL O'REILLY: Yes, but they all feel that way.

DONALD TRUMP: So I attacked back. I don't -- no, they don't, actually. He was really the only one of any consequence that went after me and a couple of little shots. But his whole thing was about going after me. And they wrote it out, just like his pollster said. He repeated whatever his pollster told him to do. And I thought it was inappropriate.

BILL O'REILLY: I was surprised they didn't come after you with the Muslim stuff more. They made -- some of the candidates made passing --

DONALD TRUMP: It was barely mentioned.

BILL O'REILLY: -- passing references.

DONALD TRUMP: -- Bill, it was barely mentioned.

BILL O'REILLY: Right.

DONALD TRUMP: Yes. It was barely mentioned.

BILL O'REILLY: Were you surprised? Because I -- if I were debating you, I would have hit you right between the eyes with hey, look, the federal courts would never allow you to bar Muslims coming into this country. It's not going to happen. So why are you saying it? That's what I would have said.

Would you have -- were you surprised that the others didn't come after you on it?

DONALD TRUMP: Well, I guess I'm glad I'm not running against you, then. The fact is, I think the federal courts, we could do it. And I think we probably would be able to. We're not talking about our citizens, we're talking about people coming from outside, some of whom are not looking at us in a very positive manner.

And frankly, I think the federal courts would be open to that. And I have some very great legal scholars telling me that's true.

BILL O'REILLY: All right --

DONALD TRUMP: So let's see what happens. But nevertheless, Bill, it's a subject that should be discussed and it has been discussed. And now people are saying, you know what -- and I'm talking about Muslims are calling me that are friends of mine. I have a lot of friends that are Muslims. And they're saying, really, this is a subject that should be discussed.

BILL O'REILLY: OK, look --

DONALD TRUMP: It's absolutely (INAUDIBLE) --

BILL O'REILLY: -- and I've said that all along, in defense of you, that you raise questions and you raise issues that we should talk about.

However, however, you know Charles Krauthammer, right? You -- you know Charles?

Charles and I --

DONALD TRUMP: And I have no respect for him whatsoever.

BILL O'REILLY: All right.

DONALD TRUMP: I have no respect for him.

BILL O'REILLY: You should watch. He's a very --

DONALD TRUMP: I think he's a very biased -- Bill -- Bill.

BILL O'REILLY: You should watch the debate I had with him about you last night.

DONALD TRUMP: I did.

BILL O'REILLY: OK.

DONALD TRUMP: And I appreciate my defense. I have no --

BILL O'REILLY: No, no, no. I was defending your campaign.

DONALD TRUMP: -- respect for Charles Krauthammer.

BILL O'REILLY: -- not your policy.

DONALD TRUMP: He is a totally biased terrible guy.

BILL O'REILLY: He doesn't want -- he doesn't think you have the policy chops. And other people feel the same way. You don't have the policy chops. So when you say --

DONALD TRUMP: I think I do. I think I know more about policy than just about anybody, Bill --

BILL O'REILLY: Of course. And -- and millions of people --

DONALD TRUMP: -- if you want to know the truth.

BILL O'REILLY: -- are -- are coming to you and you're winning. So -- and that's what I told him. I told him that your campaign is brilliant and the results are right there. But they don't think you have the policy chops.

Now, are you going to tell me tonight on this program that you don't say stuff just to get to the emotion of the voter? I know you do.

DONALD TRUMP: I'll tell you that right now I don't. I'm doing the right thing. I bring up subjects that are important. I bring up illegal immigration. I got hit so hard with that. And if I didn't bring it up, you wouldn't even be talking about illegal immigration.

BILL O'REILLY: I would.

DONALD TRUMP: You wouldn't even be talking about it.

BILL O'REILLY: All right. So you're telling me you don't do this to whip up the base --

DONALD TRUMP: And -- and by the way, Bill --

BILL O'REILLY: -- and whip up your crowd?

DONALD TRUMP: I don't. I don't. And -- but I do what's right. I do what's right. We're going to make America great again. I say what's right. I say what's on my mind. And that's what's happening. And that's why I have 42 and guys like Bush have 2 or nothing.

BILL O'REILLY: But that's based on emotion. Surely you know that it's based on emotion.

DONALD TRUMP: Because I say what -- I say what's right.

BILL O'REILLY: OK. Now, when you say you're going to take out -- we discussed this last week. You're going to take out the families of the terrorists.

Now, I didn't take that literally, like Donald Trump is going to get elected and put out hits on women and children. I didn't take it literally but some people did and you must know that.

DONALD TRUMP: I am looking at families where they know exactly what the husband is going to do, when they want to fly planes into the World Trade Center, when they want to blow up planes, when they want to blow up all sorts of shopping areas and other things and cause problems.

The families know what's going on, Bill, believe me. The families know what's going on.

BILL O'REILLY: But you're not going to assassinate them. You might arrest them, but you're not going to assassinate them, are you?

DONALD TRUMP: I don't know what I'd do. I don't know what I'd do. But I'll tell you what --

BILL O'REILLY: You don't know what you'd do? Come on.

DONALD TRUMP: -- they care more about their families -- Bill, they care more about their families than they care about themselves.

BILL O'REILLY: So you're going to assassinate them?

DONALD TRUMP: And something has to be done.

When a wife knows exactly what the husband is going to do and the husband goes up and he knocks out 200 people with a bomb --

BILL O'REILLY: You would arrest her?

DONALD TRUMP: -- or he does the -- I would do pretty severe stuff as far as I'm concerned.

BILL O'REILLY: All right. No, you didn't know what the nuclear triad was. I didn't know. I didn't know what the nuclear triad was. Remember when they threw that at you?

DONALD TRUMP: No, it was a gotcha question. I -- I viewed that as a gotcha question, you know, typical stuff with these people. Frankly, nuclear, I know a lot about nuclear and I say this. We need a very strong smart leader because we have nuclear all over the place and so does our enemy.

And we have many enemies and every week, a week -- you know, week by week, they're getting closer and closer to getting nuclear capability. We'd better make sure that stops, because --

BILL O'REILLY: All right --

DONALD TRUMP: -- once that happens, all bets are off, Bill.

(END VIDEOTAPE)

BILL O'REILLY: We will have more of Mr. Trump talking about his thin skin in a moment. Then later Karl Rove, Ted Koppel, Dennis Miller. Right back.

Continuing now with our lead story my interview earlier today with Donald Trump from Mesa, Arizona. Last night, he got a little testy with CNN.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

DONALD TRUMP: I think it's very sad that CNN leads Jeb Bush, Governor Bush down a road by starting off with virtually all of the questions, Mr. Trump this -- I think it's very sad.

But I thought it was very unfair that virtually the entire early portion of the debate was Trump this, Trump that in order to get ratings.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

BILL O'REILLY: OK, so were you mad at them? Were you mad at the CNN people when they did that?

DONALD TRUMP: I thought the debate was good. I had a lot of fun doing it. I came in number one by almost everybody even your friend Krauthammer, who is totally biased. But even him I think he thought I did well.

But -- but I will tell you this, I thought it was really unfair what CNN was doing. Every question is like, well, Donald Trump said this, how do you respond to it. And if you look at that first debate, this poor Lindsey Graham, he's got zero in the polls, zero.

But you look at the first debate and every question asked -- and I thought Senator Santorum did a really good job and I thought Governor Huckabee did a really good job. That's primarily because they like me. I mean that's one of those things. But they did. They did a good job, the two of them.

But it was very unfair, I thought, where so many questions were about Donald Trump and let's go after now Donald Trump. So I made my feelings known.

BILL O'REILLY: Do you think CNN dislikes you, the news organization itself?

DONALD TRUMP: Well, honestly, I think I get better press from CNN than I do Fox, Bill, if you want to know the truth.

BILL O'REILLY: Well, that's because we're the toughest network. I mean --

DONALD TRUMP: No. I don't know why. I don't know why.

BILL O'REILLY: Well, because that's --

DONALD TRUMP: I don't know why.

BILL O'REILLY: -- our job is to be tough.

DONALD TRUMP: But I think I get covered better --

BILL O'REILLY: You want power.

DONALD TRUMP: -- I think I get covered better --

BILL O'REILLY: All right, you want power --

(CROSSTALK)

DONALD TRUMP: I think I get covered better on CNN than I do on Fox.

BILL O'REILLY: But you want power and it's our job to vet you in the best way we can. But look, you're --

DONALD TRUMP: I don't mind.

BILL O'REILLY: -- you are -- you are too thin-skinned.

DONALD TRUMP: I don't mind bad things about me if it's true. I can handle that but when people say untrue things, I don't like it.

BILL O'REILLY: But you want to be president. Tweet about Putin. Tweet about ISIS. I mean --

DONALD TRUMP: Well, I do that, too.

BILL O'REILLY: -- it looks petty.

DONALD TRUMP: I do that, too.

BILL O'REILLY: It looks petty.

DONALD TRUMP: I do that, too, Bill.

BILL O'REILLY: Don't you think it looks petty?

DONALD TRUMP: No, I mean I do that, too. I do a lot of different things. But when people --

BILL O'REILLY: But, you know my point --

DONALD TRUMP: -- go after me -- hey look, look, like Jeb Bush went after me. He's a very low energy person. I said that. This is not what our country needs. I go after him.

I didn't start it with Jeb Bush last night. I didn't start it with him. He comes out of nowhere.

BILL O'REILLY: You don't think you are too thin-skinned. You might have to overlook some of this stuff if you become president, you know.

DONALD TRUMP: I don't think I'm thin-skinned. No. I like to have the truth told about me.

BILL O'REILLY: All right.

DONALD TRUMP: And you know what?

If I do something wrong, I know when it's wrong. And if somebody goes after me, including you, I don't mind it at all.

But when I didn't do something wrong and they make it up and they make things up, that I don't like, Bill.

BILL O'REILLY: Last question. Who on the stage last night do you believe is your main competition now?

DONALD TRUMP: Well, the new poll just came out, "Washington Post" and ABC. And it came out where I'm at 38 and second, I think, is at 14 or 15. That's Cruz. And third is Rubio and fourth is, I don't know, it gets very low numbers after that. But -- but, you know, in one of the polls I'm winning -- I'm 41 to 14. I'm winning by 7 -- 27 points -- 27 points. Do you believe that, folks?

So, you know, I -- I don't think, look, I just have to -- you know, I wish we could have the election tomorrow. I wish we didn't have to wait a month. And I'm really happy because we're doing great -- we're doing great in Iowa.

BILL O'REILLY: All right. All right.

DONALD TRUMP: The poll just came out and we're doing great in Iowa, too. I think -- I hope I'm going to win Iowa.

BILL O'REILLY: Now, are you going to sit there and dodge my question? Are you really going to do that? Who is your main competition?

DONALD TRUMP: I -- I can't say. You know, I don't think -- I don't think there's a lot of -- I -- I like a lot of the people -- by the way, I like a lot of the people (INAUDIBLE) --

BILL O'REILLY: OK -- we're glad you like them. I'm sure they're really happy you like them, too.

DONALD TRUMP: But I don't want to say who it is. You know what, if I thought that I really had major competition, I wouldn't be telling you about it, Bill. I'm not like President Obama, where he tells everybody everything, including the enemy and then the enemy knows exactly how to beat us. That's what happens.

BILL O'REILLY: All right.

DONALD TRUMP: I'm not going to tell you.

BILL O'REILLY: Look, I probably won't talk to you again before Christmas. I want you and your family to have a good one. You know, no coal in the stocking this year, Donald. Come on now.

DONALD TRUMP: No.

BILL O'REILLY: I want you to be nice to everybody.

(CROSSTALK)

I want you to send Jeb Bush a nice --

DONALD TRUMP: Merry Christmas -- Bill.

BILL O'REILLY: -- present.

DONALD TRUMP: Bill, you hear the expression, Merry Christmas.

BILL O'REILLY: Merry Christmas.

DONALD TRUMP: And Happy Holidays. But Merry Christmas -- we'll bring back the words "Merry Christmas" again, Bill. Thank you.

BILL O'REILLY: All right. Thanks for helping us out, as always.

DONALD TRUMP: The Hillary Clinton foreign policy legacy is absolute, total chaos.

Clinton also wants totally open borders in America, which would further plunge our workers into poverty. Hillary's open borders agenda means a young single mom living in poverty would have to compete for a job or a raise against millions of low-wage workers rushing into our country and we will have absolutely no idea who they are, where they come from, are they dangerous, are they good, are they bad. We know nothing about these people.

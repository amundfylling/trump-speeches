DONALD TRUMP: It was excellent. But I'm standing there shaking hands with club members. Nice people. Great people. Probably some here today. Anybody here? Is anybody here from that club that was very nice? Anybody here? Because I took so many pictures that day. So I did that. I did it as a favor. And other things. He asked me, would I come up and make a speech on behalf of James Foley? I'll do that any time. I think that was good. And I made a big contribution, a very big contribution to James Foley. And I think that's fine.

(APPLAUSE)

And I think that's fine. But I came up, I made a speech. I did a lot of things. Strange on, @realdonaldtrump. So, I have millions and millions of followers, especially when you add Facebook. It's like 5.6 million for Twitter, over five million for Facebook. Instagram it's like 11, 12 million people. And I said, what is it? He said, would you do me a favor? This is a few weeks ago. Chris Christie did not make the main stage. I would like you to do me a favor and tweet, and tweet that Chris Christie should be on the main stage. I said, but, Joe, I mean, he didn't make it because he didn't make it, right? You have to go through, you have to get a certain number of points on the polls. Well, he didn't make it but he should be there. It's not fair. Would you tweet? I said, I'll tweet. So I put out a tweet. What am I going to say? I figured I'd be nice. But I knew immediately it was going to draw -- but can you imagine a guy calling me up, knowing he's going to endorse a guy, asking me to use my Twitter to put him in. Other than that, I mean, the guy's bad news. He's not a talented guy.

Then I get a letter -- you won't believe this. I had to take the glasses out because this is worth while to read. I get a letter from one of his top people. Listen to this. Just got it recently. It's to Amanda, that's my person in charge, from Robin Wilson, the "Union Leader." "Hope all is well and that you had a wonderful holiday season. Happy New Year, Amanda. I'm emailing today because I wanted to let you know about a special edition we'll be doing just before the New Hampshire primary called Voters First. I have attached a letter that explains what will be included along with the rate card." Rate Card. This guy wants advertising. We just got the letter. It's a personal letter. It's not a letter out from a computer. "There's a perfect edition for you. I really hope you'll consider running an ad. Please let me know as soon as possible. Robin Wilson, advertising manager." OK. I'm saying, I don't believe it. The girl walked up, she said, Mr. Trump, what's going on here? My girl was even surprised. She didn't even know about it. Then the next page, this, then it's the next page after that. Think of this, this guy is running a newspaper into the ground. I mean, you had a guy, Mr. Loeb, was like this legendary guy. Look, two-page spread, $7,500. Back cover for only $3,500. Does anybody want the back cover of a newspaper that lost all credibility?

(SHOUTING)

I'll take it. I'll give you $500. Inside back, the "Union Leader, " OK? That's not the way you do business and you have a guy who's out of control, thinks he's hot stuff. He's not hot stuff.

Anyway, I just had to bring this up. It shows the dishonesty with the media. It really does. The media is very dishonest. Although I have to tell you, "Time " magazine did a cover story of me this week. It's one of the best stories I've ever read about myself. And it's really not about --

(LAUGHTER)

It's true. But it's really not about myself. It's really about you. It's about a movement that's going on. And I'll tell you what, I was -- I've been on the cover of "Time " now a number of times in the last three months. Obviously, I should have been picked as person of the year, right? Do you agree?

(CHEERING)

I think the reason -- the reason -- yeah, maybe next year. Next year would be even better because we can prove we can do things. But they didn't and they picked Angela Merkel, who is -- I mean, do you see what's going on? We talk about immigration, we talk about borders. Do you see what she's done to Germany? Just coming over just before this morning, I'm watching television, the rapes, the riots, what's happening is unbelievable. It's unbelievable. Unthinkable. They've been there for two weeks. And the place is going to hell. She got person of the year. I didn't. I guess I came in second. They felt guilty so they gave me another cover. You have to go out and get Time Magazine because it's talking about a movement of great people. It's a movement like they haven't seen. Many people are saying, there's never been anything like this in this country, what's taking place like us. Not me. I'm a messenger. It's with us.

(CHEERING)

An amazing, an amazing thing. I'm very proud of that story because that was a story -- usually I'll get a story and they usually put a shot in. They'll have three good paragraphs and one total killer. Then five good paragraphs and just a total killer. You tell people, don't read it. The killers make up for it. They have to do it. And they're dishonest. But the "Time " magazine piece -- they're pretty liberal. This "Time " cover story is amazing. It talks about what we've done and what we've accomplished.

So let's talk a little about what we're doing in terms of the competition and then we're talking about the problems of the country and how to fix the problems. Basically, how to fix the problems, elect Trump as president, OK?

(APPLAUSE)

We can cut it short. You know what we can do? That's right, President Obama, you're fired.

(CHEERING)

That's an easy one. Thank you. Got a very enthusiastic person.

(SHOUTING)

So, Ted Cruz is a problem. He's got a problem. If you know Congressman Alan Grayson said he's going to bring a major suit. The suit is going to say that he wasn't born in this country. So, whether you like it or not, Ted has to figure it out. You can't be having a nominee if he got -- I think they're going to win very solidly, if you want to know the truth. If you get a nomination, you can't have the person who gets the nomination like Hillary Clinton, who might be sued. She'll be sued on the emails. The emails -- I mean, she should not be running. Oh, would I love to run against Bernie. I would love -- oh.

(LAUGHTER)

I mean, can you imagine -- remember they took the microphone away. Get off the stage. They told him. This is our president. He goes like this. Oh, excuse me.

And everyone's out there saying, get off the Mike. We wanted to hear him. He walked back like a little puppy. This is going to be our president. I would love please, FBI, please go after Hillary. I want to run against Bernie!

(CHEERING)

Oh, that's a dream come true. This guy, he would make some president. 90 percent tax, everybody. Does anybody mind paying 90 percent? Because you go with Bernie, you'll have yourself a nice 90 percent tax. He wants to take it all away from you. He's sort of dampening it a little bit. He wants to keep it a little low key. He wants a big, fat, beautiful tax. And I don't think the people here are going to go for that very easily. But I want to run against Bernie. That's my dream. That's my dream.

(LAUGHTER)

That's the one I really want. But Hillary will be fine. The poll just said, we beat Hillary. FOX poll just out, we beat Hillary. Honestly, we'll take anybody. With the people we have, with the movement we have, and we have, by far, the largest audiences and, in all fairness, Bernie is second, but way down by comparison to the audiences we get.

We're going to Pensacola next week. They don't even know if they can have it in the whole -- I mean, they can -- the number of people showing up at Pensacola, it's unbelievable. But we had 20,000 people recently, 21,000, 35,000 in Mobile, Alabama. 20,000 in Dallas, Texas. The Maverick Arena filled up. It's unbelievable the crowds we get. And it's only determined by the size of the space.

And I want to thank the fire marshal because he allowed a lot of people in here. They have people standing at doors. Nothing's going to happen, but people standing at the doors. But the fire marshals are the most important people to me because they let us get more people into the rooms. Every one of them, they've been great. I appreciate that.

But Ted Cruz has a problem because the question is, is he a natural born citizen? The question was asked on "Meet the Press, " asked of me by Chris Wallace this weekend. I said, I don't know. Nobody knows. And Lawrence Tribe (PH) of Harvard, a constitutional expert, one of the best in the country, said -- and I wrote it down -- "This is not a settled matter." It's wrong to say it is a settled matter because it's absolutely not. It's not a settled matter. That means -- a lot of people think you have to be born here. You have to be born on this land. Now, John McCain, a Lawrence Tribe PH representative of John McCain, he was born outside of the United States but he was born on a military base to two people in the military. That's different. I would never question that. But in the case of Ted, he has to figure it out. I think he can go in for some kind of judiciary proceeding. Look, doesn't matter what he does. You can't have a nominee who's going to be subject to being thrown out as a nominee. You just can't do it. So, you're going to make that decision, folks. I mean, it's one of those little decisions. I'm sure Ted is thrilled I'm helping him out, but I am. I mean, I am. I mean, he's got go and he's got to fix it.

One thing I will say, just to finish, so I have a very strong immigration policy. When I brought up immigration, I mean, and it was brought up strongly in my speech, in my opening remarks. I said, wall and I said all sorts of things, right? That's good. Well, no, no, low key because I haven't really --

(SHOUTING)

No, no, low key. OK, ready? We will build a wall!

AUDIENCE: Build that wall!

(CHANTING)

DONALD TRUMP: Who's going to pay for the wall? Who?

AUDIENCE: Mexico.

DONALD TRUMP: So you know what I'm saying. I've been saying this for a long time. Yesterday or two days ago, they showed me Ted's plan and it said -- he never said this. It said, it begins by building a wall. It's amazing how far people have come.

(LAUGHTER)

Then triple the number of Border Patrol officers. That's me. Implement eVerify. That's me, too. By the way, Ted happens to be a very good guy. They're all good people. But they all like -- when I was taking heat, Rush Limbaugh said, nobody has ever received more incoming. And it's true. When I announced, I said, boy, for two weeks, I said, is it going to be like this always? It was brutal. Then all of a sudden, a lot of things started happening. Crime statistics started being looked at. Kate was killed in San Francisco, beautiful Kate, by an illegal immigrant, shot in the back. You had Jameel in California, who I think his father is one of the greatest people. I got to know his father over this. Jameel Shaw (PH), who's a young man getting ready to go to college, good football player, good student. He was killed, shot in the face three or four times by an illegal immigrant just walking down the sidewalk going back home to his father. You have the woman in Los Angeles who was a veteran. 65 years old, raped, sodomized and killed by a person that should have not been in this country. Illegal immigrant. And all of a sudden everybody's coming my way. They're all saying, well, wow, you know, he's right.

I don't have any -- I mean, you remember how crazy it was. Macy's was -- we're a member of inclusion. We consider ourselves very inclusive, they would tell us. They got fined $650,000 for all sorts of discrimination and they're always being looked at. As soon as I -- it's not a big deal, folks, shirts and ties. Who cares? I didn't like the ties that much anyway. They were made in China.

(LAUGHTER)

No, but how disloyal is Macy's? I tell people, don't shop there anymore. And their stock has tubed. You see what happened to their stock? Can I take credit, the fact they don't sell my shirts and ties there? The company went to hell.

(LAUGHTER)

It's unbelievable.

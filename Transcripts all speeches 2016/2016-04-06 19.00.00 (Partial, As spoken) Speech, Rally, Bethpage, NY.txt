DONALD TRUMP: Thank you. Thank you, everybody. Unbelievable! Unbelievable! Thank you so much. Thank you, everybody. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very much. First of all, it's great to be home. This is home. It's great to be home. We love New York and we are all together going to make America great again, folks.

(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

So I was driving over from Manhattan, and I passed queens. I love Queens. Do we have a lot of Queens? I grew up in Queens. I grew up in Queens. And I used to play, you know, I used to get here at like 2:00 in the morning to play a round of golf at Bethpage. You all know what I mean, right? But I love this city and I love this country, and we are going to start winning again with our country because we don't win. We never win. We never, ever win anymore. We don't win with our military. We don't win on trade. We don't win on health care. We don't win on anything. We are going to start winning again, folks.

(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

So in coming up, I said to myself and I said some of the people when we were in the car -- I said, you know, I'm self-funding my campaign. I'm putting my own money in, right? And all these people that are running for office, they're like off the throat, they take money in from all the special interest where they can't make proper transactions for you and that's going to stop. It's going to stop. You look -- you look -- you look at what's happening -- I love you too. I love these people. These are my people.

(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

I have so many family members here today. Look at that. Boy, oh, boy, my sons and my daughter. Did Ivanka do a good job? You know she had a baby like five days ago, so she did a good job. So I should not say, Ivanka, you're fired, right? I promise. I promise. I promise. So, I love this. You know, somebody else would say that's a tough crowd. It is for the heart. We love this crowd. We love you people. We love you people. We love. So, here's what we're doing. On June 16th, I came out and I said -- and it's not easy to do. It take guts. I came down the escalator with Melania. I said, come on, let's go. I took a deep breath. And it was all about trade. It was all about borders, it was all about all sorts of things. And today it's that, but it's also about our military. We can't beat ISIS. We're going to knock the hell out of ISIS. Believe me.

(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

Can you imagine what our great generals, General George Patton, General Douglas MacArthur, can you imagine what they'd be saying if they saw what's going on with what we're doing and the way we fight? We don't fight like people from Long Island. We don't fight like people from New York. So we're going to rebuild our military. It's totally depleted. You know it. We know it. They don't like talking about it. We are going to rebuild our military. It's going to be bigger and better and stronger than ever before, and nobody is going to mess with us. Nobody. And very, very important we're going to take care of our vets. Our vets are not taken care of.

So our country owes now $19 trillion.

(CROWD BOOING)

We owe trillions to China. We owe trillions to Japan. The whole thing is absolutely ridiculous. It's going to change around. It's going to change quickly. We are going to renegotiate our trade deals in China. The case of China, $500 billion trade deficit every single year. It's going to end. Mexico. I love the Mexican people. I love Hispanics. I love Hispanics. They're unbelievable people.

We have now $58 billion trade deficit with Mexico, and our businesses are sadly leaving our country going to other countries. They're leaving our jobs. In Long Island, you know it better than almost anybody. Our companies are being uprooted, taken out, they're moving to Mexico. They're moving to other countries. Everybody is looking for jobs. And you know what? We're going to end the practice. We're going to keep our companies here, and we're bringing companies back to the United States.

(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

(CROWD CHANTING BUILD A WALL, BUILD A WALL, BUILD A WALL, BUILD A WALL, BUILD A WALL, BUILD A WALL!)

We are going to have a strong border. We are going to build the wall. It will be a real wall, a real wall. Are you ready? Are you ready? Are you ready? Who is going to pay for the wall?

AUDIENCE: Mexico.

DONALD TRUMP: Who?

AUDIENCE: Mexico.

DONALD TRUMP: By the way, 100 percent. When these politicians come up, they say you can't really get Mexico to pay. I just put out a plan three days ago so easy. When we're losing $58 billion a year in trade deficits and a wall is going to cost $10 billion, folks, how easy is that? It's going to happen, OK? It's going to happen. One hundred percent it's going to happen.

(CROWD CHANTING BUILD A WALL, BUILD A WALL!)

Go ahead.

(CROWD CHANTING)

It never changes. Hey, New York is called New York --

(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

It never, ever will change. So what's happened and very strongly what's happened? We are going to have those strong borders just as you saw last week. The border patrol, 16,500 people in the border patrol endorsed -- and I didn't even ask -- endorsed Donald Trump for president.

(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

The first time they've ever done it. They have never endorsed anybody for president, but they want to have strong borders. And you know what? I thought to myself has anybody heard the snake. Has anyone heard of it? Have you heard? Should we do it? Should we do it?

All right. The main thing -- can you hear me all the way in the back? Can you hear me? Can anybody not hear me clearly? All right. I want to thank my brother, my cousins, my nephews, my beautiful daughters- in-law, my son, wonderful Ivanka as you know. They all came to see this, I mean, they can't even believe it. You know, you know, Lyin' Ted Cruz came today. He couldn't draw 100 people. A hundred people.

(CROWD BOOING)

He couldn't. I'm telling you. In fact, it was a big headline today in "The New York Post." He couldn't draw 100 people. Now, do you remember -- do you remember -- do you remember during the debate, when he started lecturing me on New York values, like we're no good, like we're no good. And I started talking to him about the World Trade Center, the bravery, the incredible bravery of everybody, our police, our firemen, our everybody.

(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

Better believe it. Better believe it. So, I looked at him and started talking about our incredible police, our incredible firefighters, our incredible people, our unbelievable construction workers. Who could have done that? Who could have rebuilt that hole? There was never anything like it in this country, the worst attack in the history of the United States. The bravery that was shown was incredible. We all lived through it. We all know people that died. And I have got this guy standing over there looking at me, talking about New York values with scorn in his face, with hatred, with hatred of New York. So, folks, I think you can forget about him. You can forget about him.

AUDIENCE: Lyin' Ted! Lyin' Ted! Lyin' Ted! Lyin' Ted! Lyin' Ted! Lyin' Ted! Lyin' Ted! Lyin' Ted! Lyin' Ted! Lyin' Ted! Lyin' Ted! Lyin' Ted! Lyin' Ted!

DONALD TRUMP: He is Lyin' Ted. You know, I came up with the idea. But you have to spell it right. It's L-Y-I-N', Lyin' Ted. The Bible held high, he put it down, and then he lies. You know the wonderful thing? He lies like crazy. But most of the time, I win the evangelical vote. The evangelicals, the Christians like Donald Trump. I am a straight shooter. I shoot straight, like New Yorkers. We shoot straight. You have another one running, he was in favor of NAFTA. Do you remember that?

Kasich. Kasich. He is now -- he is now zero for 32, except he won his state. So, he's like one for 33. And he just -- he won't leave. And that's OK. You know what? He is a nice guy. Let him keep going. It's OK. It's all right. It's all right.

But both of them -- and this is so serious. Both of them, we have a deal under negotiation, being negotiated by President Obama, which you immediately know it's going to be a bad deal. A bad deal. Don't forget, Obama negotiated the Iran deal, one of the worst deals ever, ever, ever negotiated.

So what we have -- what -- thank you, darling. I love -- screaming "Love. I love you Trump, I love you, Trump." Thank you. Thank you. I love you. I love you. I do. I do.

So, both of them want TPP, which is Transpacific Partnership. It is a disastrous deal. It is going to suck the blood out of New York. It is going to suck the blood out of our country. Both of them want it to happen. I'm going to fight it and we're going to stop it. We're not going to let it happen. We have enough bad deals. This deal would be catastrophic.

So, look, let me just tell you a couple of things. So we have to bring our jobs back to this country. We have to stop making horrible trade deals. We have the greatest businesspeople in the world in the United States. I know many of them. I know the good ones, the bad ones. The overrated ones, I know, and the underrated ones, people you have never heard of, who are phenomenal.

(BREAK)

So I've called a lot of shots. And I've gotten credit, pretty much, for calling a lot of shots. I have an instinct, and I do have a good instinct for it. And we have a thing called the migration. Now we have illegal immigrants pouring into our country. We don't know what's happening. That'll stop. But we have the migration. We have people coming in by the thousands with no documentation, with no parperwork. We don't know where they come from. We don't know who they are. You watch what happens. It could be ISIS. I hope not. But you watch what happens. You see what happened in Paris. You see what happened in California.

(BREAK)

So here's a story. You think of this in terms of the people coming into the country especially coming in from Syria. We don't know where they are, we don't know who they are, we don't know how they're getting in. They're all over the place. Believe me. It's going to be a problem. You think of this, all right? This is called the snake. On her way to work one morning, down the path along the lake, a tenderhearted woman saw a poor half frozen snake. His pretty colored skin had been all frosted with the dew. Well, she cried, I'll take you in, and I'll take care of you. Take me in, oh, tender woman. Take me in for heaven sake. Take me in tender woman. Beside the broken snake. She wrapped him up all cozy in a curvature of silk and then laid him by the fireside with some honey and some milk. Now she hurried home from work that night as soon as she arrived, she found that pretty snake she'd taken in finally, finally had been revived. Take me in oh, tender woman. Take me in for heaven sake. Take me in oh, tender woman beside the broken snake.

Now she clutched him to her bosom. You're so beautiful, she cried. But if I hadn't brought you in by now, heavens you might have died. Now she stroked his pretty skin and then she kissed him and held him tight. But instead of saying thank you, that snake gave her a vicious bite. Take me in oh, tender woman. Take me in for tender sake. Take me in oh, tender woman sigh the broken snake.

I save you, cried the woman and you bit me heaven's why. You know your bite is poisonous and now I'm going to die. Oh, shut up, silly woman, said the reptile with a grin. You damn well knew I was a snake before you took me in.

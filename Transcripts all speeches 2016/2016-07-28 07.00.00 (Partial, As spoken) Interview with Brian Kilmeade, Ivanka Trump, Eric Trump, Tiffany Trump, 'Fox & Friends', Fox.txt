BRIAN KILMEADE: So, Donald Trump, you packed this arena in Pennsylvania. There's a sense in that room that for the first time in a long time, a Republican can win this state.

DONALD TRUMP: Well, I think we're going to win it, it's a great state. The miners are out of business, the gas has been regulated to a point where they can't produce.

We have so many problems in Pennsylvania, we're going to put the miners back to work, we're going to put the steel workers back to work. We're going to bring jobs back to Pennsylvania.

BRIAN KILMEADE: How hard is it to watch speech after speech, the only thing that's constant is personal hits on you. You watch, take it in, how hard is that?

DONALD TRUMP: Well, they don't all hit me, but some of them do, and they try to hit you as hard as possible, and it's mostly false stuff. But I get it, I mean it's the way it goes, it's called politics.

But look, they're doing their thing, they're trying to win, they're trying to justify 8 years of horror.

BRIAN KILMEADE: So, you're not taking it personally?

DONALD TRUMP: I guess, I take it a little bit personally, but you can't let it get you down. You have to go out --

BRIAN KILMEADE: (INAUDIBLE) a press conference, and one line is getting a lot of press. You said --

DONALD TRUMP: Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing.

And I'm being sarcastic with some of the --

(CROSSTALK)

BRIAN KILMEADE: Well, you're being sarcastic? --

DONALD TRUMP: Of course, I'm being sarcastic, and they don't even know frankly if it's Russia. They have no idea if it's Russia, if it's China, if it's somebody else.

Who knows who it is? But you have 33,000 emails deleted, and the real problem was what was said on those emails from the Democratic National Committee.

You take a look at what was said on those emails, it's disgraceful. It's disgraceful. They talk about religion, they talk about race, they talk about all sorts of things including women, and what they said on those e- mails is a disgrace, and they're just trying to deflect from that, absolutely.

BRIAN KILMEADE: So, then Jake Sullivan weighs in and said this will be the first time that a major presidential candidate has actively encouraged a foreign power to conduct espionage against a political opponent. Are you --

DONALD TRUMP: I didn't encourage anybody. First of all, said with sarcasm, second of all, we didn't encourage anybody, they may have them.

Who knows who has them. They don't know, they have no idea, and it's pretty sad when a foreign country, whether it's them or China or anybody else, disrespects us so much that they would even do a thing like that.

BRIAN KILMEADE: When you look at Vladimir Putin, you said he's a great leader of his country, but he's also a guy that --

DONALD TRUMP: No, I didn't say that, I said he's a better leader than Obama.

BRIAN KILMEADE: But he does get rid of --

DONALD TRUMP: I said he's a better leader than Obama because Obama is not a leader. So, he's certainly doing a better job than Obama is, and that's all.

Now look, you'd have to understand. Putin, if we could get along with Russia, I think that will be a good thing --

BRIAN KILMEADE: Right --

DONALD TRUMP: Not a bad thing. We don't get along with Russia. We practically don't get along with too many.

BRIAN KILMEADE: But you -- we have a criteria to be friends with so many. So bigger than maybe Ukraine, if they're going to buzz our ships that they're doing right now, and --

DONALD TRUMP: You know why? You know why they do that because they have no respect for our leader. That's why they do it --

BRIAN KILMEADE: Yes, they did it --

DONALD TRUMP: They have no respect --

BRIAN KILMEADE: They did that with you in office --

(CROSSTALK)

DONALD TRUMP: They have a zero respect for our leader --

BRIAN KILMEADE: If they showed no respect for --

DONALD TRUMP: I don't think they'd be doing that. I don't think they'd be doing that for one minute.

BRIAN KILMEADE: Because?

DONALD TRUMP: Because I think they respect me.

BRIAN KILMEADE: Because you --

DONALD TRUMP: They don't respect President Obama.

BRIAN KILMEADE: Would you answer with force?

DONALD TRUMP: I'm not going to tell you what I'd do. Why would I tell you a thing like that? Wouldn't that be crazy to tell you what I'd do?

You react at the time -- part of the problem with this country is they go and they say, we're going to do this, we're going to attack here, we're going to send this many men.

No, you got to keep it a little bit secret. You got to keep it a little bit secret, you got to have it to yourself a little bit.

BRIAN KILMEADE: Lastly, personal question. How hard was it if at all as a parent to watch your kids --

DONALD TRUMP: I was so proud of my kids and my family, the way they got up at that unbelievable moment and made these incredible speeches.

IVANKA TRUMP: I've loved and respected him --

ERIC TRUMP: You are my hero, my mentor, my best friend.

TIFFANY TRUMP: And I love him with all my heart.

BRIAN KILMEADE: You don't get choked up with something like that --

DONALD TRUMP: Well, I don't know --

BRIAN KILMEADE: You don't want to show yourself of this side --

DONALD TRUMP: Well, I know, but I was so proud of them. I mean, I was watching -- -- I think I was so proud, I maybe don't get choked up for that reason.

I have a good life, a wonderful family, wonderful business, wonderful everything, I didn't need to do this. I'm getting to know the American people, these are amazing people.

And they're tired of being pushed around --

BRIAN KILMEADE: Yes --

DONALD TRUMP: They're tired of working harder than they did 18 years ago and making less money. It's an incredible, beautiful movement. We're going to make America great again and we're going to make America safe again.

SEAN HANNITY: Donald Trump thinks it's time for a change, a big change.

DONALD TRUMP: African-American communities have suffered under Democratic control!

SEAN HANNITY: African-Americans are getting crushed by the Obama economy.

DONALD TRUMP: Nearly 4 in 10 African-American children live in poverty. Fifty-eight percent of African-American youth are not working.

SEAN HANNITY: Many Democratic-controlled cities are being overrun by crime and violence.

Last month was the deadliest July in a decade for the residents of the Windy City.

UNIDENTIFIED: They could care less if it's an 80-year-old grandmother or a 5-year-old child out there.

It has to stop. It really has to stop.

SEAN HANNITY: And the left is stoking racial tensions.

PROTESTERS: Black Lives Matter!

DONALD TRUMP: Vote for Donald Trump. I will fix it.

SEAN HANNITY: And Donald Trump is the only candidate promising to bring about real change.

DONALD TRUMP: The Democrats have taken advantage of African-Americans! We will rebuild our inner cities and provide safety and peace to all of our citizens.

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

(END VIDEOTAPE)

SEAN HANNITY: And welcome to "Hannity." And tonight, we're broadcasting from the Civic Center in Cleveland Heights, Ohio. Now, it's the home of Darrell Scott's church, the New Spirit Revival Center. Now, Reverend Scott is the CEO for the National Diversity Coalition for Donald Trump, and he has graciously allowed us to use his facility for tonight's town hall.

Now, he has invited members of his congregation to participate, and other Donald Trump supporters that live in the area that were invited to attend, as well.

Now, Donald Trump will join us in just a minute for the entire hour. But first, President Obama -- he started out by promising hope and change and a better tomorrow. Here we are, eight years later, and here's where we are as a country.

These numbers don't lie. We have the lowest labor participation rate since the 1970s. Almost 95 of our fellow -- million of our fellow Americans are out of the labor force. America has now had the worst recovery since the 1940s. The country now has the lowest home ownership rate in 51 years. There are now almost 13 million Americans -- more Americans on food stamps. We have over 43 million Americans living in poverty. That's 8 million more than when Obama became president.

Median household income is now lower than it was in 2007. Today in America, one in five households do not have a single family member that works. One in six American men age 18 to 34 -- they're either in jail or out of work. And President Obama will be leaving office having accumulated more debt than all 43 presidents before him combined.

Now, all the president's failed policies have disproportionately also impacted the black community in America.

Now, since Obama took office, there has been a 58 percent increase in the number of African-Americans on food stamps. We have seen a 20 percent jump in the number of African-Americans who are no longer in the labor force. Now, the African-American home ownership rate -- that is also down. It's more than 20 percent lower than the national average.

African-American unemployment is 8.1 percent. The national average is 4.9 percent. The wage gap between African-Americans and white workers is the worst in nearly 40 years. Median household income for African-Americans is $20,000 less than the national average. And the African-American poverty rate is 24.1 percent. That is over 10 percent higher than the national average.

Now, there's also been a surge in inner city crime. In Chicago, for example, President Obama's hometown, over 3,100 people have been shot this year alone. And since Obama has been in office, 3,660 people have been murdered. And according to The Chicago Tribune, historical stats now show that 75 percent of those victims are African-American.

Then on top of all of that, our educational system in America is especially bad in inner city America. High school graduation rates are 9 percent lower for African-American students than the national average, and according to the most recent statistics, the high school dropout rate for African-American students is also higher than the national average.

Now, the results should be much better given that the U.S. -- get this -- is now ranked fourth in the world in terms of money we spend per pupil. Now, per student, it works out to be $11,600 per student. Now, despite the high spending, America ranks 17th in reading, 19th in science, 26th in math.

And by the way, we've not even talked about the disaster that is Obama and Hillary Clinton's foreign policy -- Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan, Egypt, Libya, Syria, China, North Korea, Russia. Hillary Clinton wants to continue, she says, Obama's policies. Now, the country deserves better, and the African-American community deserves better.

Tonight, Donald Trump joins us for the entire hour to talk about where we are and what he will help do to fix these problems, if he's elected president. For most of this hour, I'll be turning things over to this audience and let them ask the GOP nominee the questions that are on their mind.

We've got a lot to get to, so help me in joining and welcoming the 2016 Republican presidential nominee, Donald Trump.

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

DONALD TRUMP: Hello, everybody.

SEAN HANNITY: Well it's great to see you. How are you?

DONALD TRUMP: Very good, thank you.

SEAN HANNITY: You heard all of those statistics. You cite a lot of them in your speeches.

DONALD TRUMP: Right. I do.

SEAN HANNITY: Really bad.

DONALD TRUMP: Bad. Very bad. For the African-American community, very bad, and honestly, for the community of this country. I mean, we're not doing well. You know that. Our good jobs have been taken away. They've gone to Mexico, they've gone to all over the place, but they haven't come back to us, so we're going to make some very big changes.

SEAN HANNITY: But disproportionately, black Americans have suffered the most.

DONALD TRUMP: Totally, absolutely, not even close. That's why I say, you know, like, I can fix it. We're going to fix it. And I always say, What do you have to lose? Some people like that, and some people don't, but it's like -- and people are using that statement all over the place now. What do you have to lose? It's so bad. Some of the inner cities are so bad that it's -- look, it's a disgrace, frankly, what's happened.

SEAN HANNITY: You look at these numbers, a 20 percent jump in the number of African-Americans no longer in the workforce, 58 percent increase black Americans on food stamps -- this is only since Obama has been president. Home ownership rate -- I go through the entire list.

You have made it a point in this campaign to go to specifically to reach out to black Americans, go to black churches, and say, Give me a chance. Historically, Republicans haven't done that. Why is this so...

DONALD TRUMP: Well, I think maybe I'm a little different than a lot of the Republicans. I think some of the states we're leading, like I see we're doing great in Maine, we're doing great in Connecticut, we're doing great in places that normally a Republican wouldn't do as well, and some of them, I mean, really, they wouldn't do well at all. They haven't won these states in years. Colorado has been amazing. It's been, like, incredible what's gone on. Wisconsin, we're doing great. So you know, we're doing well in places that a lot of people wouldn't do very well.

SEAN HANNITY: What are the specific ideas in your economic plan? I know, for example, trade is a big part of it. I know you're going to let multi-national corporations bring back trillions of dollars from overseas. You've talked at length about energy independence.

How does that help people that are here, people that are in cities like Detroit, cities that are deteriorating?

DONALD TRUMP: Well, it's about jobs. Look, our jobs have been stripped. You look at Detroit, where I went with -- I tell you what, we had such an amazing time with Bishop Jackson, and here we have -- I'll tell you, my pastor, right? What a pastor, Darrell Scott.

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

He's become a big television star. But he's never going to leave anybody over here. But he's become a big television...

SEAN HANNITY: He co-hosts my show now every...

(CROSSTALK)

DONALD TRUMP: Oh really, is that right? OK.

(LAUGHTER)

But he is a fantastic -- you have some incredible people. And by the way, they're not allowed really to speak their mind, you know, because if they do, they have the Johnson amendment to contend with, we're going to terminate that jobs. These are the people that you want to have speaking to you and freely speaking to you.

(APPLAUSE)

But we need jobs. We need jobs, desperately need jobs. Now, obviously we need the schools, we need the education, we need all sorts of things, and especially the inner cities. The inner cities are -- I mean, can you say never? But certainly, one of the worst stages ever in the history of the inner city. It's so unsafe, where you walk down the street, and you get shot or your child gets shot.

So we're going to really fix the inner cities. We're going to spend a lot of time. The Democrats have run them for 100 years, mostly uninterrupted, I mean, nobody else, just uninterrupted, and you see what's happened.

SEAN HANNITY: The high school graduation rate, 9 percent lower for African-Americans than the national average. High school dropout rate, African-Americans, is higher than the national average. Inner city schools seem to be suffering the most. You say, let local communities and states handle education.

DONALD TRUMP: Well, we're taking away Common Core. Common Core out of Washington is a disaster, right?

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

We're going to knock it out -- boom, boom. And I mean, look at the people. Look at the way -- right? Look at the way they -- the mothers and the aunts and the uncles and the fathers. They want to run their schools, and right now, you can't. They're being run out of Washington by people that -- look, I'm sure some are very good and very caring, but a lot of them are just bureaucrats that want to pick up a check. We want the schools to be run locally.

SEAN HANNITY: Let me ask you about what has been going on in Charlotte. You saw what happened last night in North Carolina. The police did say that the individual was armed, they announced this morning.

But you have these high-profile cases. It all started with Obama saying the Cambridge police started -- acted stupidly. Trayvon -- That could have been me 35 years ago. He'd look like my son. He weighed in on Ferguson and Michael Brown and Freddie Grey and all these high-profile race cases.

But I just gave a statistic that I think should shock everybody's conscience and soul -- I'm in a church, Pastor -- and that is, 3,660 people are dead since Obama's been president in his hometown of Chicago!

DONALD TRUMP: Yes.

SEAN HANNITY: I bet there's -- I bet nobody knows the names of any of those 3,660!

DONALD TRUMP: Yes.

SEAN HANNITY: Why is that?

(APPLAUSE)

DONALD TRUMP: Well, the violence in the inner city is incredible. In particular, I watched Tulsa. And I know Tulsa. This is the man just happened.

SEAN HANNITY: Right.

DONALD TRUMP: Hands up. He was doing everything he was supposed to do, Sean.

SEAN HANNITY: I saw it.

DONALD TRUMP: Everything. And a young policeman (SIC) shot this man. I don't -- I don't get it. I don't -- you can come -- I don't care where you're coming from, there was something really bad going...

SEAN HANNITY: I saw it. He had his hands up.

DONALD TRUMP: I don't know if she choked. He was walking, his hands were high, he was walking to the car, he put the hands on the car -- now, maybe she choked. Something really bad happened! But this is something -- you know, it's...

SEAN HANNITY: How do we stop this cycle of violence? And more particularly, I mentioned Chicago, 75 percent of those shootings are black Americans, 3,660 since Obama's president.

DONALD TRUMP: Yes.

SEAN HANNITY: This year alone, over 3,000 shot in one city. Now, I would think if it was your home city of New York, you would have gone to New York and...

DONALD TRUMP: Well, I was in New York when it was really -- the number was never like that. I mean, Chicago is -- you know, you take some of these cities, it's worse than -- and there's two Chicagos. There's the luxury Chicago, where I have this incredible hotel, and it's a whole different world. And then you have the other side of the world, where it's horrible.

Now, I have to say, the crime is just beyond anything -- it's worse than Afghanistan. You know, I said worse than some of the war-torn cities, and you know that's true. But in New York, we had -- Rudy Giuliani did a fantastic job. He was a great mayor. He really was.

(APPLAUSE)

And we had horrible numbers, and we had a wonderful police commissioner working with Rudy, and they started stop and frisk. And they did a great job. And New York became, from one of the more unsafe cities to one of the largest, maybe the largest safe city -- I think -- right? I think it was the largest safe city...

SEAN HANNITY: About 2,500 murders...

DONALD TRUMP: ... in the world (INAUDIBLE)

SEAN HANNITY: ... down to 500.

DONALD TRUMP: Yes. So it went -- it was unbelievable. And it was stop and frisk. Now they've stopped it in New York. Let's see what happens. But Chicago, maybe more than ever, you're going to need something because what's going on there is absolutely out of control.

SEAN HANNITY: Let me -- let me ask this question. Hillary Clinton has played the race card against you in this campaign. She's talked about, I guess all of us, if you're supporting Donald Trump, you're a deplorable person, irredeemable.

Pastor, I thought everybody was redeemable if you say you're sorry for your sins, right? OK.

And that racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic...

DONALD TRUMP: She went through the whole list.

SEAN HANNITY: The whole list. And checked everything off. Does that aggravate you? Does that annoy you?

DONALD TRUMP: Well, you have to know from where it comes. I mean, I understand what's going on, and you know, it's their only hope. They see what's happening with the polls. You see what's happening with the polls. We have a movement going on, Sean, and this is white, black, Asian, right, everybody. We have a movement going on -- Hispanic...

(APPLAUSE)

... because people are tired of what's going on in the country. You know, we've spent trillions of dollars -- $6 trillion now in the Middle East, and you come to Cleveland or you go to Detroit or Philadelphia, and we can't build a school. We can't even paint the classrooms.

SEAN HANNITY: Yes.

DONALD TRUMP: We build schools in these places, and they knock them down, we build them again, they knock them down, we do it a third time -- look, it is insane. We've spent 6 -- we're up to $6 trillion in the Middle East, and our roads have potholes, our highways are in bad shape, our bridges are falling down. So it's -- people are tired of it.

SEAN HANNITY: When she uses all of those names -- now, she has taken money from countries like the UAE and Kuwait and Oman and Saudi Arabia. So she says, you're racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic, but she takes money from a country that tells -- where men tell women how to dress, women can't drive, women are told whether they can go to school or work. Gays and lesbians are killed for being gay and lesbian, and by the way, they persecute Christians and they persecute Jews. Is that hypocrisy?

DONALD TRUMP: Well, look, everybody understands what's going on there, and it's a whole pay for play deal. And a lot of people have been saying it, and for some reason, nobody is picking it up. They're just not picking it up. They don't want to pick it up. They don't like seeing what's happening in the polls. They don't like where we're leading in Florida. We're leading in Ohio.

SEAN HANNITY: And by the way, the electoral map, according to Reuters, you're -- it's 243 to 242. That's how close the race is.

(APPLAUSE)

Coming up, we're just getting started, Donald Trump with us for the entire hour. Coming up next, we'll talk to the Reverend Darrell Scott, Reverend C.L. Bryant, and much more. Also, Don King is in the house. He'll join us straight ahead.

DARRELL SCOTT: (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

And we refuse to allow those who have selfish political ambitions, the selfish political ambitions of selfish politicians or selfish political parties, to continue or endeavor to divide us in order to continue to subjugate us!

(APPLAUSE)

And I believe that the person that God has raised up for such a crucial time in this nation, for this nation, is Mr. Donald Trump.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

SEAN HANNITY: And welcome back to "Hannity." And we are on the road at the Civic Center. We're in Cleveland Heights, Ohio. That, of course, Pastor Scott, Reverend Pastor Scott, talking about Donald Trump earlier today. He joins us, along with radio talk show host Reverend C.L. Bryant. Don King is here with us, as we continue with 2016 Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.

(APPLAUSE)

As I promised, I am turning it over to the audience.

Sir, welcome. Thank you for being with us.

UNIDENTIFIED: Thank you. How you doing, Mr. Trump?

DONALD TRUMP: How are you?

UNIDENTIFIED: Good. My name is Ricardo Simms, and I had a question about -- there's been a lot of violence in the black community. I wanted to know, what would you do to help stop that violence, you know, black-on-black crime...

DONALD TRUMP: Right. Well, one of the things I'd do, Ricardo, is, I would do stop and frisk. I think you have to. We did it in New York. It worked incredibly well. And you have to be proactive...

(APPLAUSE)

... and you know, you really help people sort of change their mind automatically. You understand. You have to have -- in my opinion, I see what's going on here, I see what's going on in Chicago. I think stop and frisk -- in New York City, it was so incredible, the way it worked.

Now, we had a very good mayor, but New York City was incredible the way that worked. So I think that would be one step you could do.

SEAN HANNITY: I'll just add one thing to Mr. Trump's comments. The murder rate was around 2,500, a very high percentage of African-Americans, and it went down below 500 because of the increased police activity in communities. So it was lives saved every year because of the concern and the resources.

Pastor Scott, you see the violence. I gave the numbers about Chicago. How does this end?

DARRELL SCOTT: Well, you have to change minds in order to change activity. So if we can -- Mr. Trump has talked about...

(APPLAUSE)

TIM SCOTT: ... stimulating the economy and providing jobs. I talked to Mr. Trump in Trump Tower about this issue, and he told me he believes a major source of crime is unemployment and a lack of income. So if he can solve that job problem and we improve our living conditions, it would cause a change in mind which would cause a change in action.

(APPLAUSE)

SEAN HANNITY: It starts with education. You have talked -- explain -- I think this education thing is not talked about enough.

DONALD TRUMP: Well, the inner cities are a disaster as far as schools are concerned, education -- you know, we build schools all over the Middle East and yet we don't build schools for our own children.

The schools in the inner city, the jobs -- and really, what Darrell said is 100 percent. We don't have -- you know, our jobs are being stolen from us. They're going to other countries. And the inner cities are absolutely being devastated in terms of jobs.

You can speak to some people, 50-year-old men, great people, great men -- I don't know if they're as good as Don King, but they're pretty good, right?

(LAUGHTER)

And these are people that had great jobs, and they don't have their jobs anymore. And the job has moved to Mexico. Their factories have moved, their manufacturing has moved to Mexico. And we're not going to let that happen anymore, and we can stop it so easily.

SEAN HANNITY: Pastor Bryant, I was a paper boy at 8, washed dishes by hand at 12, a cook at 13, a bus boy at 14, a waiter at 15, a bartender at 17, and then I worked the next 7 years in construction, building houses, laying tile, painting and hanging paper. Fifty-five percent of black teenagers cannot get a summer job. If I didn't have those jobs, I would have been hanging out with all my dopey friends and getting in a lot of trouble.

C.L. BRYANT: Right. And you know, Sean, in order to tap into the free market and understand capitalism, and of course, make the best of what America has to offer, you need an example. And for too many inner city young people, there's no example of how to make money. That's one of the reasons why I think that Mr. Trump will be a perfect president for this present time to African-American youth because he...

SEAN HANNITY: What do you think as a pastor -- and I'll ask both of you pastors -- when they play the race card and they run Klan ads against Donald Trump, I can't think of anything more despicable. If I remember, Pastor, my theology class was, right, Thou shall not bear false witness was one of the big 10.

(LAUGHTER)

(APPLAUSE)

What do you think when you see that?

C.L. BRYANT: I think that because they can't attack him on policy, they try to make it personal. They appeal to the emotions and the sensitivities of not only the black community but the foreigners and females. So they'll say, don't vote for Donald Trump, females, and they'll arouse those emotions. He's a misogynist. He doesn't -- he suppresses and dominates women. Don't vote for him, blacks or Hispanics, because he's a racist. And don't vote for him, foreigners, because he's a xenophobe. So they attack him and try to make it personal, but they don't attack him politically because that's all they have!

SEAN HANNITY: That's a good point. And I will say this because this is important...

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

Those statistics -- Don King, you have more diamonds on you than anybody I've ever seen!

(LAUGHTER)

I think we got -- we got to show that cross there to the pastor!

(LAUGHTER)

That's the biggest one I've ever seen. But Don King, you are an example of an entrepreneur, hard-working, that made money in America, not the statistics that I'm reading. What advice could you give, and what are you asking Donald Trump to do for the black community?

DON KING: Well, what I'm asking Donald Trump to do is what Donald Trump volunteered to do, it is to change the system. It doesn't matter about -- whatever we see, right, wrong, or indifferent. If the system don't change, it's going to be the same. So I say, Well, what would make Donald Trump different from Obama or any other president? Because he will call them out, the same as he did when Lindsey Tucker -- what's his name, Lindsey...

SEAN HANNITY: Graham.

DON KING: ... Lindsey Graham -- you just say something to him, he's a fighter. He's going to fight back. So what the difference is, he would tell on the people who are obstreperous that are blocking the change for the progressive of human beings.

First of all, for blacks, we're the first to be included. We can do all this talk about what you're going to do about jobs, what you're going to do about this -- if you ain't included, and the system do not include us, you know? And white women -- they don't include you.

(INAUDIBLE) and he's the first one that came up with that. He wants to first create a whole new system, take this system apart, and then put people together to work together, each one to have a part in it to be able to make it happen, working collectively together. Working together works.

SEAN HANNITY: Mr. Trump, this is a diversity coalition, and we have a diverse audience here tonight. What does it mean to you to see people of all races and all religions and all backgrounds going to bat for you in this election the way they are?

DONALD TRUMP: Well, it means a lot. And Don King is an example. First of all, he's a great entrepreneur. You know, he's the greatest boxing promoter ever, but that's the ultimate entrepreneur.

(APPLAUSE)

And Don King has been my friend for 25 years. He knows me better than most people know me.

DON KING: That's correct.

DONALD TRUMP: And when he called me -- and this wasn't just recently, a long time ago, he endorsed me for president. And I shouldn't tell them this. I think he endorsed Bernie Sanders for vice president, so...

DON KING: Yes.

DONALD TRUMP: (INAUDIBLE) say that.

DON KING: But number one, number two, you know...

DONALD TRUMP: He was very happy with Mike Pence. I have to -- where is Mike?

SEAN HANNITY: Right there.

DON KING: Mike's (INAUDIBLE) advent because Bernie couldn't stand up. He couldn't give up that party loyalty. But he was the number one and number two vote-getters...

SEAN HANNITY: You were doing great up until now. You really were.

(LAUGHTER)

DON KING: It was the people that would be the ones. But you know, I look at it, like, when we first started in this country, the two highest votes would be -- the highest would be president and the second would be vice president. There would be four parties, you know what I mean? The two vote-getters would get that.

SEAN HANNITY: I think America wants success and results.

(CROSSTALK)

They're hurting.

DON KING: He's the epitome of it. He's the spirit of America. John Paul Jones, you know, when the captain said, Do you surrender, do you surrender, he said, I have not yet began to fight. Coming against the British ship, you know what I mean, he went on and maligated (SIC) himself to the promised land!

SEAN HANNITY: When we come back, we'll have more questions from our audience right here in Cleveland Heights, Ohio.

(CROSSTALK)

... Larry Elder (INAUDIBLE) they'll join Donald Trump on stage. That and more as "Hannity " continues.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

DONALD TRUMP: One day, I said, What do you have to lose? I mean, what do you have to lose? I'm going to fix it. What do you have to lose?

(END VIDEO CLIP)

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

SEAN HANNITY: And welcome back to HANNITY. And joining us now, from the Tea Party Forward Chairman is Niger Innis, national syndicated Salem radio talk show host Larry Elder, and senior adviser for the African-American outreach for the campaign, she goes by one name, Omarosa.

(LAUGHTER)

Good to see you. You were great last night, both of you, thank you.

We're going to go back to the audience as I've been promising. Sir, how are you? Thank you for joining us.

UNIDENTIFIED: My name is Staff Sargent Corbin Mason. I'm medically retired, a disabled veteran.

(APPLAUSE)

With the opiate problem that we're having in this country, I watch my friends get addicted, I watch my superiors get pill chase and all that, but my question is, what is your opinion on the criminal justice system for tending to the drug sentencing for addicts and for those who sell them?

DONALD TRUMP: Well, it really starts, it's a huge problem. The drug the problem in this country is incredible. It's coming from the southern border, much of it, a real big percentage of it. You take a place like Ohio, and you go to New Hampshire, you go to Pennsylvania, you go to so many of the different places -- North Carolina, South Carolina, it's just pouring into our country, all over. I mean, all over. Some states worse than -- New Hampshire has got a problem. It's their number one thing. They don't talk about, that's what they want to solve is the heroin problem, the problem with drugs.

We have to strengthen our borders. We're going to build a wall. Believe me, the wall is going up. We have --

(APPLAUSE)

The drugs that -- the drugs are coming in, they're poisoning our country. Not only our youth. We always say youth. Well, the youth is being poisoned, but the whole country -- I mean, men, women, 50-years-old, 70-years-old, I've never seen anything like it. The drugs are pouring across the border. It's like water. And we're going to solve that problem.

We have to also help the people that are addicted. We have so many people already addicted. We have to help them. That's a great question.

SEAN HANNITY: You know, I was down on the border 12 times, all the way from the Rio Grande to San Diego. I was in a helicopter, boats, all-terrain vehicles, horseback, believe it or not. And I went into a drug warehouse bigger than this room times 10, floor to ceiling drugs. Big problem in every community in America now, especially this heroin epidemic.

Niger, I know you talked about it. How do we -- if we build a wall, isn't that going to prevent a lot of those drugs from coming in?

NIGER INNIS: It's not only building the wall, which needs to be done. It's a question of leadership. You and I, Mr. Trump, were in New York in the early 90s, and when Rudy Giuliani came in, he created a revolution in New York that reduced crime, homelessness, and the crisis.

SEAN HANNITY: He was attacked, remember, he was attacked for being a racist because he went into the communities where the crimes were taking place, and lo and behold, people's lives were saved.

NIGER INNIS: Absolutely. And I have no doubt that Mr. Trump will do for the United States of America what Rudy did for New York.

(APPLAUSE)

SEAN HANNITY: Larry, you're the sage from South Central. You, me, Niger, we've been friends a long time. Both of you as friends have taken a lot of heat for being black Americans and conservative. Historically, the black vote goes to the Democratic Party. Why?

LARRY ELDER: The Democratic Party has convinced black people that they're victims, that they're perpetual victims, and these guys over there, Tea Party, Republicans, black Republicans, Republicans in general are the villains. And we wear the white hat, they wear the black hat. That's what they've done. The number one problem facing the black community is the absence of fathers in the home.

(APPLAUSE)

I've been doing radio for about 25 years, and in 25 years I've asked Reverend Jesse Jackson to come on my show about 50 times. He won't do it. Sharpton about 50 times, he won't do it. I've asked Farrakhan several times. The one black leader who did come on my show was Kweisi Mfume when he was head of the NAACP. My first question was, Mr. Mfume, as between the presence of white racism or the absence of black fathers, which poses the bigger threat to the black community? Without missing a beat, he said the absence of black fathers.

(APPLAUSE)

SEAN HANNITY: Omarosa, you have emerged as one of Mr. Trump's most ardent supporters. Didn't he fire you?

OMAROSA MANIGAULT: Yes.

(LAUGHTER)

DONALD TRUMP: Barely.

(LAUGHTER)

SEAN HANNITY: Barely.

OMAROSA MANIGAULT: Barely.

SEAN HANNITY: Once or twice?

OMAROSA MANIGAULT: Three times.

SEAN HANNITY: Three.

(LAUGHTER)

OMAROSA MANIGAULT: But I'm the only one --

UNIDENTIFIED: Who's counting?

OMAROSA MANIGAULT: -- three seasons of The Apprentice.

SEAN HANNITY: That's good.

OMAROSA MANIGAULT: And I need to note that he also produced a show for me on TV-1, an African-American owned network, and not a lot of people know that. So he actually invested in me as a talent and in my business.

(APPLAUSE)

SEAN HANNITY: You know but --

DONALD TRUMP: And she did a great job.

(APPLAUSE)

SEAN HANNITY: You don't ever tell this story. I -- look, I've known u for decades now. And I've been to Trump Towers many, many times. There is nothing but diversity working for you --

DONALD TRUMP: No.

OMAROSA MANIGAULT: Absolutely.

(APPLAUSE)

SEAN HANNITY: I've seen it myself. I watch -- witnessed it myself. And then I watch these attacks against you, if it was me, I think I'd be pretty ticked off.

DONALD TRUMP: Well, you know, the one thing I see is that when you start to win -- and I've watched this not just for me, I've watched it over the years, when you start to win and win and win --

SEAN HANNITY: I know.

DONALD TRUMP: -- they have nothing to say. And they can't stop you. They always start using the racist word. And it's a very interesting phenomenon, but the word "racist " comes out. And that means that you're winning and that's their last chance. And I don't think it's working.

SEAN HANNITY: Yes.

OMAROSA MANIGAULT: Can I point out --

SEAN HANNITY: Yes?

(APPLAUSE)

OMAROSA MANIGAULT: We have a huge diversity coalition called The National Diversity Coalition, founded by Michael Cohen, Darrell Scott, Bruce LeVell, who's here. Can I have those members of The National Diversity Coalition just stand up?

SEAN HANNITY: Absolutely.

OMAROSA MANIGAULT: Do you mind?

SEAN HANNITY: Absolutely.

OMAROSA MANIGAULT: Will the members of The National Diversity Coalition please stand up?

UNIDENTIFIED: Thank you, Scott.

OMAROSA MANIGAULT: All races, all backgrounds, all religions.

(APPLAUSE)

And they've been with us from the beginning, from the beginning. And one of the first meetings that we set up in Trump Tower was with 100 African-American ministers. This was last year. No one knows that, no one takes notice that the first thing that we did was to get him in front of faith leaders so that he could have a real dialogue and share his vision for this country.

SEAN HANNITY: Isn't it -- don't you think -- and you've said this -- I -- I watched your Saturday morning speech in Detroit and I went on the air the next Monday and I said I thought that was the best speech you gave.

OMAROSA MANIGAULT: That was beautiful.

SEAN HANNITY: And you talked about --

(APPLAUSE)

And what you said -- first of all, I was glad to see you there, a predominantly black church. And what you said is the backbone of this country was built in America's churches and specifically black churches.

DONALD TRUMP: That's true. You know, it's true. And that's a fact. And I saw such love in that room. That was an amazing morning for me. That was Bishop Jackson.

SEAN HANNITY: Right.

DONALD TRUMP: What an amazing guy he is, and his family, his wife, who's really such a -- an important part of the church. The -- the church was, I mean, packed, just, say, you know, it houses --

SEAN HANNITY: A typical day in the life of Trump.

(LAUGHTER)

Everything packed.

DONALD TRUMP: Yes. No, no, this -- this church was packed, I guess at least -- I -- I mean well over 1,000 people.

OMAROSA MANIGAULT: Absolutely.

DONALD TRUMP: You were there. And it was really a beautiful thing. And the song and the love and the, you know, the -- the feeling in that room was incredible.

And I got up and made a speech. And you feel it from the heart. That was an amazing group of people. And I tell you what, he's an amazing -- he's Bishop Jackson. I did an interview with him, and so many people saw that interview, so many people told me about that. But it was a really great morning.

SEAN HANNITY: We'll take a break. We'll come back. When we come back, Dr. Benjamin Carson and his wife Candy, they will join us, that and more as we continue, HANNITY ON THE ROAD with Donald Trump from Cleveland Heights, Ohio.

(APPLAUSE)

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

DONALD TRUMP: I will always support your church and defend your right to worship always. I will always be there.

(APPLAUSE)

(END VIDEO CLIP)

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

I am here today to listen to your message. And I hope my presence here will help, and very much help, your voice to reach new audiences. It's going to happen in our country, and these are people, believe me, there are many people out there that desperately need it. Christian faith is not the past, but the present and the future. It is the foundation of progress.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

SEAN HANNITY: That was Donald Trump speaking to pastors earlier today right here in Cleveland Heights, Ohio.

Joining us now along with Donald Trump is Dr. Benjamin Carson and his wife, Candy. Good to see you.

BEN CARSON: Good to see you.

(APPLAUSE)

CANDY CARSON: Good to be back.

(APPLAUSE)

SEAN HANNITY: You were one of the first Republican candidates, one of the 17 -- he kind of beat up a lot of people, uh, in that primary to support him. And I just talked to you earlier tonight. You're -- you're like passionate. You want him to be president.

BEN CARSON: Yes. Well, he's a very good man. There's a lot of things that people don't know about him. But one of the things that I noticed when I was running. for instance, during the, uh, the debate when we had the moment when I couldn't hear my name --

SEAN HANNITY: Yes.

BEN CARSON: -- everybody else walked by. He stood there with me --

SEAN HANNITY: I remember that.

BEN CARSON: -- and then there was another time --

(APPLAUSE)

-- another time, you know, he was chastising the media because they wouldn't ask me any questions. The moderators wouldn't ask. They kept trying to skip over me. He was the only one who said anything. The rest of them were perfectly happy with it. So you know, he's -- and I was the competition. So it tells you that he does have some -- a lot more integrity than the other people there.

But also, you know, I wasn't particularly anxious to run for president, to be honest with you, but I did it because there were so many people clamoring for it. I had thousands -- hundreds of thousands of petitions and I said I can't turn my back on the American people. But I was secretly hoping that there was somebody who had the same kinds of values and principles, who would -- would stand the terrible corruption that is throughout our system --

SEAN HANNITY: Let me ask you this, with your background as a brain surgeon, a real brain surgeon --

(LAUGHTER)

Since Obama has been president -- remember, he promised you keep your doctor, you keep your plan, on average, the average family will save $2,500 per family per year?

BEN CARSON: Right.

SEAN HANNITY: Well, since Obama has been president, the average family is paying $4,100 more for health care.

BEN CARSON: Right.

SEAN HANNITY: If Mr. Trump came to you and said, Dr. Carson, I want you to help me repeal and replace Obamacare with free market competition or health savings accounts, what would you say?

BEN CARSON: I would say I and a lot of people that I know --

SEAN HANNITY: Just say yes.

BEN CARSON: -- and am associated with will be very happy to help with that.

(APPLAUSE)

SEAN HANNITY: Good to see you, and good to see you, as well. And by the way, these guys hosted my radio show one day together as a team. And everyone called in and said we want them, not you.

(LAUGHTER)

All right, we'll take a break. Thank you both.

When we come back, our last segment. Governor Mike Pence will join us on stage as we continue with Donald Trump from Ohio.

(APPLAUSE)

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

And welcome back to HANNITY. And joining us now is Donald Trump's running mate, Indiana Governor Mike Pence, as we continue with the Republican presidential nominee.

(APPLAUSE)

I think Hillary didn't have a rally for 19 days in August, I hear she is off again today prepping, I guess, for the debate, and five days from now, you will be debating Hillary Clinton.

DONALD TRUMP: I will. That's right.

SEAN HANNITY: And you're ready?

(LAUGHTER)

DONALD TRUMP: Whatever. I'm here.

SEAN HANNITY: All right, I'm going to ask this in front of Mike Pence. Don't you think her whole strategy is to get him annoyed and mad?

MIKE PENCE: I, you know, I don't know what her strategy is, but I --

SEAN HANNITY: She certainly can't run on her record.

MIKE PENCE: -- I can tell you, the contrast between Hillary Clinton -- who has a -- has a career of dishonesty, probably the most dishonest candidate for president in history, and this bold truth teller --

(APPLAUSE)

-- is going to be dramatic and I'm -- I'm very, very confident the American people are going to see that Donald Trump is the right man at the right time to make America great again.

(APPLAUSE)

SEAN HANNITY: Governor, you heard the numbers that I gave at the beginning of the show -- unemployment numbers, the labor participation, home ownership rate, 12 million more Americans on food stamps, 8 million more in poverty, doubling of the debt. The people here tonight and at home, they want to know that their lives are going to change for the better and opportunity is coming back.

MIKE PENCE: Well, I --

SEAN HANNITY: What do you tell them?

MIKE PENCE: Well, I said today at -- at the church gathering where we were before, this is a broad-shouldered leader, but he's also a man that's impatient with failure. He's impatient with failing leadership and failing policies. And I think the American people are learning more and more every day, when he talks about making America great again, that's for every American regardless of race or creed or color or gender. That's an inclusive message.

(APPLAUSE)

And that's why it's resonating all over the country.

SEAN HANNITY: Donald Trump, last word. You were invited into this church. You have made outreach to the black community, the Hispanic community paramount in your campaign. What is the last word you want to tell them?

DONALD TRUMP: Well, I'm just very honored by how well we're doing with the Hispanic community and the African-American community. I want to thank Darrell and all of the people here in Cleveland. It's been incredible.

(APPLAUSE)

It's been an incredible day.

(APPLAUSE)

And I think they're --

(APPLAUSE)

I think they're really doing a good job. You look at the inner cities, you look at what's going on, how they just -- just -- they're not being helped. They're not being helped. And we're going to help them. We're going to fix it. We're going to really make life better for people, and that's so important.

SEAN HANNITY: Ronald Reagan asked, are you better off than you were eight years ago? I'll ask this audience, are you better off than where you were eight years ago?

AUDIENCE: No!

SEAN HANNITY: The answer to the question. Mr. Trump, thank you for being with us.

DONALD TRUMP: Thanks.

SEAN HANNITY: Governor Pence, thank you.

(APPLAUSE)

All right, that's all the time we have left this evening. Thank you for being with us. Thank you, Darrell Scott. We appreciate it, Reverend. And thanks to all of you.

(APPLAUSE)

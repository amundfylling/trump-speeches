DONALD TRUMP: Something happened to Romney. He choked. I always said he choked. For a month and a half before the election you didn't see him. Say what you want about Obama. He was on Jay Leno, he was on David Letterman. He was all over the place.

And I said to these people, I was backing Romney. I said, when are you going to go on television? Then he announces he is building a 12-car garage in Malibu, California. Remember that fiasco. This is not what people and the horses. His wife has horses. Anyway, he loses. We should have won.

STEPHANIE RUHLE: In order to be the President of the United States, you have to be a leader in so many ways. We haven't seen your soft hand. We've seen your offense, but George W. Bush had to stand in front of America after 9/11, Barack Obama did after Sandy Hook. Help us understand who Donald Trump is as a man. I need to know that you will make us feel safe and you will make us feel proud.

DONALD TRUMP: I think I have a bigger heart than all of them. I think I'm much more competent than all of them. When you talk about George Bush, and say what you want, the World Trade Center came down during his time.

STEPHANIE RUHLE: Hold on, you can't blame George Bush for that.

DONALD TRUMP: He was president. Blame him, or don't blame him, but he was president. The World Trade Center came down during his reign. If you look at Sandy Hook, those people are still begging for help. It is a disaster, and it is a disaster all over the place. Government has proven to be a disaster during the Obama administration. What we need is a leader. We don't have a leader.

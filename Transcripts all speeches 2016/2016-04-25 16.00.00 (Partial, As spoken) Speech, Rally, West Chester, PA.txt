DONALD TRUMP: Did you see they joined forces?

(CROWD BOOING)

I've been doing this for 10 months and these two guys, they're politicians all their lives, that is all they do. And now, they joined forces and you kept hearing oh, they're doing well, they're doing well. I have millions of votes more than each one of them.

(APPLAUSE)

We have -- despite the fact system is totally rigged and it is rigged, it a bad system, we have hundreds and hundreds of delegates more. This is supposed to be an incredible weekend. You must go out and vote tomorrow. It's a rigged system. It is a crooked system. It is as crooked almost as Hillary Clinton. She is Crooked Hillary. She is Crooked Hillary.

(APPLAUSE)

Did you see the poll just came out? We're tied with Hillary Clinton all of sudden. That didn't take long. I get a kick out of Kasich. He goes around saying he is beating her in the polls. By the way, did you ever see a man eat like this? I'm always working with my son, little tiny pieces, Baron, little tiny pieces. This guy is shoving pancakes -- I never saw anything like this. It is pouring out of his mouth. And the cameras are on him. I don't know. Look, that is not presidential, I can tell you.

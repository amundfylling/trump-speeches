DONALD TRUMP: A Trump administration will also secure and defend the borders of the United States. And, yes, we will build a wall and, yes, Mexico will pay for the wall. They will pay for the wall.

Crooked Hillary has pledged open borders, which means there goes your country, and she supports sanctuary cities. No longer, folks. She wants open borders. You saw that during the debates. WikiLeaks got her again. She never talked open borders. She wants open borders. We could have 600 million people pour into our country. Think of it. Once you have open borders like that, you don't have a country anymore.

(BREAK)

When you read WikiLeaks, when you see that Podesta... I tell you what, I would fire him so fast. He speaks so badly about her. "She's got bad instincts." Oh, I won't even say it. He says things about her that I won't say about her. Do you believe it? I would fire John Podesta so fast. Whoever he is. I don't think I ever met the guy, but he says such bad things about her and others say such bad things. It's amazing what you learn from looking. I tell you what, if she never heard the word "email" do you think she'd be a very happy person today?

It was just learned now, by the way.

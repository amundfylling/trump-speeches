DONALD TRUMP: At one of the events, a beautiful baby was crying. And I mean crying like you wouldn't believe. This baby could have been Pavarotti.

In fact, I'm going to find out who that baby is. I'm going to make a deal with the parents, because we can take that baby to training school and it will be the next great Pavarotti. This was a beautiful baby and beautiful mother. And the baby was crying. And I jokingly said, you know what? That's OK. Let the baby cry. We love babies. Something to that effect. Love babies.

Then, about two minutes later, it didn't stop. It just went on. And I'm trying to speak in front of thousands. We had thousands of people in the room. And I said, all right. I actually said the first time, all right, keep the baby here. Don't worry about it. Then, after two minutes, I said, you know what, I'm going to counteract my order.

Beautiful baby, if you take her outside, that's not so bad. That was it. The whole place laughed and we had a good time.

The press came out with headlines, Trump throws baby out of arena. So dishonest. I have heard so much about that beautiful baby, beautiful parents. So much. I don't throw babies out, believe me. I love babies. I love my children. I love babies. I don't throw babies out, believe me.

We have a very, very dishonest media. I do want you to remember that, because when you read, like you will read this story tomorrow. And you will hear everything very different from what we all know it's like, like the baby, like that beautiful baby. I love that baby. I love that baby.

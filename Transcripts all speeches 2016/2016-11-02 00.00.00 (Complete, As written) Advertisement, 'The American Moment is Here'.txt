VOICEOVER: The American moment is here. Two choices. Two Americas. Decided -- by you. Hillary Clinton will keep us on the road to stagnation. Fewer jobs. Rising crime. America diminished at home and abroad. Donald Trump will bring the change we're waiting for. America -- better, stronger, more prosperous for everyone. A plan for tomorrow. A future, brighter than our past. The choice -- is yours.

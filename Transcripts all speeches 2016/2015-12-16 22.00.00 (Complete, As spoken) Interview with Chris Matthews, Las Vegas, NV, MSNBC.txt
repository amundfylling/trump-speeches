CHRIS MATTHEWS: Good evening. I'm back in Las Vegas here. And I got sitting with being me front-runner for the Republican presidential nominee. He is about 40 percent right now, if you average it out. Maybe 42 by his count. Jeb Bush who was supposed to be number one is at three. What happened?

DONALD TRUMP: I don't know. He is a nice man. I mean, I got to like him a lot. Although, he was a little aggressive tonight. He tried to -- you know, I think I would probably be doing the same thing if I were him. But you know what? He's a good man. And I understand what he is doing.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: You are acting like a winner tonight. You said tonight that you would run as a Republican. No third party option. What changed your mind? Because you have talked about that. You said if they don't treat you fairly in the Republican Party, you were going to pull.

DONALD TRUMP: I mean, basically if you look what's happened, I'm number one by a lot, I think by 27 points. And since what am I going to do? Leave and run as an independent? You know, it doesn't. And over the last four or five month, I have got into a lot of great Republicans. And I think they are all going to come together. They are going to coalesce and we are going to do very well. I have had some terrific poll against Hillary. You know, FOX came out last week where we beat her by five points. And I think we're going to --

CHRIS MATTHEWS: But those polls are crazy. One of the poll shows like Carson beating her. Do you believe that?

DONALD TRUMP: Well, you never know. I mean, you will never know. He's a quality guy. I mean, we were talking to him before. He is a very high quality guy.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Let me try a reciprocal question. As a good Republican now, would you endorse and support whoever wins on your party's side?

DONALD TRUMP: Yes, I would.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: With enthusiasm?

DONALD TRUMP: With enthusiasm. I mean, I've gotten to know most of them pretty well. I like a lot of them. I can't say I love everybody, but I like a lot of them. And I respect quite a few of them.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Let's talk about something that grabbed me. There is Malani over there. Hello, Malani, thank you for standing here and letting us have you hear.

You said that if we hadn't gone into these wars -- and a lot of people who what watch this show agree with me about this. This is war in Iraq, I don't buy the theory of WMD. I don't think they -- I think they one in the force. They believed in it. They cooked up the term WMD. What was that? They did say it was to get into war. All these things knocking off Libya, knocking off Gadhafi, and knocking up Mubarak. You said if we hadn't go in that, we could spent that $4 trillion or $3 trillion to build this country up.

DONALD TRUMP: I don't even have any idea how much it is. And not only that. How about all the lives?

CHRIS MATTHEWS: How do we go forward and find that money again to rebuild the country?

DONALD TRUMP: Well, we are just going to have to do it. I mean, we are going to have to stop all the nonsense. We totally destabilize the Middle East. The war in Iraq was a disaster. And you know, look. You and I have known each other a long time. You went to give me the University of Pennsylvania many years ago. And I have a lot of respect for you.

The fact is that if you look at what we did in Iraq, we just totally destabilize the Middle East. And I've been against it from 2003, 2004. You see articles all over.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Four guys tonight, Carson, you, Cruz and Paul. You had a pretty good fight going with the neo-con crowd led by Cruz.

DONALD TRUMP: What did we get out of it?

CHRIS MATTHEWS: I'm sorry, Cruz is on your side. Rubio is the other side. It was a good fight.

DONALD TRUMP: We spent $4 trillion. We have a country that's falling apart, our infrastructure, our roads, our highways, our schools, our hospitals, our airports are falling apart. I go all over the world. I go to some of these countries where they have airports the likes of which we never see.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: I know.

(CROSSTALK)

I took the train with my son two weeks ago. I took a train in (INAUDIBLE). You can go on a train in Zurich and you put the diet coke on the armchair and it sits there for the whole trip. You try that on Amtrak. So, are we going to rebuild our rail system?

DONALD TRUMP: We have to rebuild our country. But we can't do that we are going to spend trillions of dollars doing all of this stuff. Look, the question is, would we have been better off if Gadhafi was there. And I mean, the answer is what did we get out of it? We got nothing out of it. I tell you what we got out of it. We got death out of it. Look at all the people on both sides.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: I've got another question for you.

DONALD TRUMP: Go ahead.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: You have great numbers nationally. Real Clear Politics (INAUDIBLE), you have 40 in this poll. Just ABC just came out, 38, 41, let's adds up to 40. But you're not doing it in Iowa. And Iowa seems to be fading over to the religious rights.

DONALD TRUMP: Well, PPP just came out, I'm leading in Iowa. In the CNN, I was up by 13, but nobody ever reported it.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: What I don't understand, you know, I saw the book you put out (INAUDIBLE). Can I read it through? It was all very phallic, by the way, all these big buildings you put up. Everyone stall. They all look great. One page after I said why doesn't this guy run a TV campaign like that in Iowa? He talks about his built. Say you the builder against this guy, the debater. You want a debater and you want a builder. You want a 6'3" builder or a 5'8" debater? I would play tougher than you. Why don't you talk about building? Why don't you build?

DONALD TRUMP: So I happen to be watching. You know what, I happened to be watching. And I said what a great idea. We are going to do it. You know, what I said? Why don't you take like even for a couple of seconds each, I build so much between everything I build, buildings all over?

CHRIS MATTHEWS: What has Cruz ever built?

DONALD TRUMP: Well, I don't want to get into because he has been so nice to me.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: He's not going to stay nice to you.

DONALD TRUMP: No. At some point, he has to.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: He was hedging towards you tonight. He was moving towards you.

DONALD TRUMP: He was. He was very nice. I mean, I think he was very nice, very respectful. I respect him. But you gave me a great ad. I'm doing the ad. I'm doing the ad.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Is that a good thing?

DONALD TRUMP: No, it is great. I said, you know, what, I came out -- at first, I listened I said wait a minute, that's a great idea. I'm doing an ad like that.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: OK. I ask you last question before you leave. You can leave, but I would like you to stay. Is Donald Trump honest when he says that Barack Obama isn't a legitimate president?

DONALD TRUMP: So I knew you were going to ask me that question.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: It's a good question.

DONALD TRUMP: I didn't say you couldn't. I knew --

CHRIS MATTHEWS: You can't stop me.

DONALD TRUMP: Because you know, I should really -- no, I can't. I should not tell you this, but I do watch you a lot. So I knew you were going to ask that question.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Because he is president of the United States.

DONALD TRUMP: I don't answer that anymore.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: You answer the questions you like.

DONALD TRUMP: by the way, this guy is a total professional. I have to tell you. Here is I said. I don't answer, because if I do answer, that's all people want to talk about.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: If you answer, it's over.

UNIDENTIFIED: You're going to have to answer it in a general election.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: If you take the oval office, the president leaving the office is illegitimate?

DONALD TRUMP: But I don't answer that question, because once I answer the question, they don't want to talk about the economy.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: No, it's over. You know, we, Catholics believe in confession. You say you were wrong and you move on. You really believe this guy isn't a legitimate president?

DONALD TRUMP: I don't want to answer the question. I don't want to answer the question. Did you have a good time? Was it a good interview?

CHRIS MATTHEWS: What this? Well, I watched you for a longer time, but thank you, Mr. Trump.

DONALD TRUMP: We will do it again. I would love to.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Mr. Trump, I do think that is a blemish. I think it is your original --.

DONALD TRUMP: No, I know how you feel.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: I think because I am American. I think our president should be respectful. And I think he is a little ethnic aspect to and I don't like it. He's African-American and we're saying he's not a real president? I don't like that. It is not a good thing about you. I'm allowed to say you're a mixed bag. Thank you. We'll have you for an hour.

DONALD TRUMP: Thank you. Take care of yourself.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: We will have for an hour.

DONALD TRUMP: We'll do it.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: We'll go to Wharton.

DONALD TRUMP: We will do it the same.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: We will pay for the whole thing.

DONALD TRUMP: The cathedral, right?

CHRIS MATTHEWS: That's right. Thank you, Mr. Trump.

DONALD TRUMP: You take care of yourself.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Thank you.

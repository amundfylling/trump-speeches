LESLIE STAHL: The Republican National Convention that begins tomorrow in Cleveland will star Donald Trump and his chosen running mate, the governor of Indiana, Mike Pence.

The Republican leadership has praised Pence as a good choice to unite the party. He's known as a reliable conservative with close ties to the religious right and he also has good relations with Republicans in Congress, having served six terms in the house of representatives. But there are significant areas in terms of values and policy where he has differed with Mr. Trump in the past.

We had the chance to ask the two of them about that in their first and only interview together yesterday afternoon in New York, in Trump's three-story penthouse apartment in the Trump Tower.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

First of all, Governor Pence, congratulations.

MIKE PENCE: Thank you.

LESLIE STAHL: This has probably comes as a huge, life-changing moment for you.

MIKE PENCE: It has. It's very, very humbling and I couldn't be more honored to have the opportunity to run with, and serve with, the next president of the United States.

LESLIE STAHL: Before we actually talk about the politics, you know, there have been so many major world events very recently in the last week. I don't know if you can remember the last time we have seen a world this much in chaos. You even said, it's spinning apart. Are you ready for this world that we are facing today?

DONALD TRUMP: We're both ready. I have no doubt. We need toughness. We need strength. Obama's weak, Hillary's weak. And part of it is that; a big part of it. We need law and order. We need strong borders.

LESLIE STAHL: But all reactions to what's been going on aren't muscular. For example, look what happened in Turkey. There was a military coup in a democratic country, a NATO ally. How would you respond to that?

DONALD TRUMP: Well, as a president, I'm going to be -- you know, they've been an ally and I stay with our allies. They have been an ally. But that was a quick coup. I was actually surprised to see how well it was handled. And you know who really handled it? The people. So, I mean, we can say what we want, but the people handled it. When they surrounded the army tanks -- and without the people, you would've never had it. The military would've taken over.

MIKE PENCE: But I truly do believe that the larger issue here is declining American power in the world. I truly do believe that history teaches that weakness arouses evil and whether it be the horrific attack in France, the inspired attacks here in the United States, the instability in Turkey that led to a coup. I think that is all a result of a foreign policy of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama that has led from behind and that has sent an inexact, unclear message about American resolve.

One of the reasons why I said yes in a heartbeat to run with this man is because he embodies American strength, and I know that he will provide that kind of broad-shouldered American strength on the global stage as well.

LESLIE STAHL: Let's -- let's talk about what happened in Nice. Horrendous carnage, horrible -- of innocence.

DONALD TRUMP: Horrible.

LESLIE STAHL: Horrible. You said you would declare war against ISIS. What exactly do you have...

DONALD TRUMP: It is war. By the way, it is war.

LESLIE STAHL: No, but does that -- when you say, declare war, do you want to send American troops in there? Is that what you mean?

DONALD TRUMP: Look, we have people that hate us. We have people that want to wipe us out. We're going to declare war against ISIS. We have to wipe out ISIS. These are people that...

LESLIE STAHL: With troops on the ground?

DONALD TRUMP: I am going to have very few troops on the ground. We're going to have unbelievable intelligence, which we need, which, right now, we don't have. We don't have the people over there. We are going to use...

LESLIE STAHL: You want to send Americans...

DONALD TRUMP: Excuse me -- and we're going to have surrounding states and, very importantly, get NATO involved because we support NATO far more than we should, frankly, because you have a lot of countries that aren't doing what they're supposed to be doing. And we have to wipe out ISIS.

And speaking of Turkey, Turkey is an ally. Turkey can do it by themselves. But they have to be incentivized. For whatever reason, they're not. So we have no choice.

LESLIE STAHL: But I still don't know if you're going to send troops over...

DONALD TRUMP: Very little. I'm going to...

LESLIE STAHL: But declare war...

DONALD TRUMP: ... get neighboring states and I'm going to get -- we are going to get NATO, we're going to wipe 'em out. We're going to...

LESLIE STAHL: Declare war?

MIKE PENCE: Lesley...

LESLIE STAHL: What does that mean...

MIKE PENCE: This is -- this is the kind -- this is the kind of leadership that America needs and it...

LESLIE STAHL: But what...

MIKE PENCE: ... and it begins with deciding to destroy the enemies of our freedom.

LESLIE STAHL: How?

MIKE PENCE: And how we do that? I have every confidence. You -- you remember I served on the Foreign Affairs Committee. And I'm very confident that when Donald Trump becomes president of the United States, he'll give a directive to our military commanders, bring together other nations, and we will use the enormous resources of the United States to destroy that enemy.

DONALD TRUMP: Now look, we are going to get rid of ISIS, big league. And we're going to get rid of 'em fast. And we're going to use surrounding states. We're going to use NATO, probably. And we're going to declare war. It is war. When the World Trade Center comes tumbling down, with thousands of people being killed, people are still -- I have friends that are still...

(CROSSTALK)

LESLIE STAHL: But we did go to war, if you remember. We went to Iraq.

DONALD TRUMP: Yeah, you went to Iraq, but that was handled so badly. And that was a war -- by the way, that was a war that we shouldn't have entered because Iraq did not knock down -- excuse me...

(CROSSTALK)

LESLIE STAHL: Your running mate...

DONALD TRUMP: Iraq did not...

(CROSSTALK)

LESLIE STAHL: ... voted for it. I don't care.

What do you mean you don't care that he voted for?

DONALD TRUMP: It's a long time ago. And he voted that way and they were also misled. A lot of information was given to people.

(CROSSTALK)

LESLIE STAHL: But you've harped on this.

DONALD TRUMP: But I was against the war in Iraq from the beginning.

LESLIE STAHL: Yeah, but you've used that vote of Hillary's that was the same as Mr. -- Governor Pence...

(CROSSTALK)

... as the example of her bad judgment.

(CROSSTALK)

DONALD TRUMP: Many people have, and frankly, I'm one of the few that was right on Iraq.

LESLIE STAHL: Yeah, but what about he...

(CROSSTALK)

DONALD TRUMP: He's entitled to make a mistake every once in awhile.

LESLIE STAHL: But she's not? OK, come on...

DONALD TRUMP: But she's not.

LESLIE STAHL: She's not?

DONALD TRUMP: No. She's not.

LESLIE STAHL: Got it. I have to move on or we're never going to find out why he chose you. Why did you pick him? You had other candidates...

DONALD TRUMP: OK, I did. I had a lot of people that wanted it. A lot more people than anybody...

LESLIE STAHL: That came to you and begged you for it?

DONALD TRUMP: That called me, and came to me and wanted it badly. And you know, the press didn't report that. The press said, well, maybe he's having a hard time picking...

LESLIE STAHL: Well, what about the governor? Did he want it like that?

DONALD TRUMP: I actually brought it up to him.

LESLIE STAHL: OK.

DONALD TRUMP: I got to know him during the -- when I was in Indiana, during the primaries. And I did very well in Indiana, like I did just about everywhere (INAUDIBLE).

But I got to know him very well. And I gained great respect for him. And I looked at the numbers, meaning the financials, which we would say in business. But I looked at the numbers -- unemployment, what great job he did. Jobs, what a great job he did. Triple A rating on his bonds.

LESLIE STAHL: But you went to him and said....

DONALD TRUMP: I did.

LESLIE STAHL: ... would you want to be considered.

(CROSSTALK)

And then he said, I really want it. So why did you pick him?

DONALD TRUMP: I would say that he thought about it a little bit, and about two seconds later, he called me with his incredible wife and said, yeah.

LESLIE STAHL: That I'd like to be -- but does he...

DONALD TRUMP: Like many others.

LESLIE STAHL: ... how does he help you? How does he help you win in terms of groups of people?

DONALD TRUMP: Right.

LESLIE STAHL: And what is your weakness that he compensates for and so forth?

DONALD TRUMP: Well, I went for the quality individual rather than I'm going to win his state, because I'm doing very well in Indiana, I guess I'm a lot up. And I think I'm going to win Indiana.

I have a great relationship, and Bobby Knight helped me so much with Indiana. Indiana is a great place, great state.

LESLIE STAHL: Why did you pick him? No, I'm talking...

(CROSSTALK)

DONALD TRUMP: Obviously, it would have been very good. But he -- terrific guy. But -- but I really liked him as an individual.

LESLIE STAHL: So you must have considered, you know, obviously by the reaction to your choice, a lot of the conservatives are very happy.

DONALD TRUMP: Very happy.

LESLIE STAHL: Was that part of it, do you think?

DONALD TRUMP: Yes. It was party unity. I am an outsider. I am a person that used to be establishment, when I'd give them hundreds of thousands of dollars.

But when I decided to run, I became very anti-establishment, because I understand the system better than anybody else.

LESLIE STAHL: Is he establishment?

DONALD TRUMP: He is very establishment in many ways, and that's not a bad thing, but I will tell you...

LESLIE STAHL: Because it's interesting.

DONALD TRUMP: ... I have seen more people that, frankly, did not like me so much and now they're saying, what a great pick. You see the kind of reaction.

He -- he has helped bring the party together. I understand -- look, I got more votes than anybody, but I also understand there's a faction...

LESLIE STAHL: Is it already unified?

DONALD TRUMP: I think it's very close to unified. And I will say...

LESLIE STAHL: Just because of this pick?

DONALD TRUMP: No. I think it's -- I think it's much more unified than people thought.

You saw that with a recent vote where we won in a landslide. You saw that with the big vote, the primary vote. I think it's far more unified than the press lets on.

But having Governor Mike Pence has really -- I mean, people that I wasn't necessarily liking or getting along with are loving this pick, because they have such respect for him.

LESLIE STAHL: And that was the main thing?

DONALD TRUMP: And party unity is OK. You know, I think it's OK to say I picked somebody because I -- as one of the things. But I really believe the main reason I picked him is the incredible job he has done. Just look at the economics of Indiana and what's going on.

LESLIE STAHL: In Indiana. But what about the chemistry between you two? You don't really know each other that well.

You're -- at least I've read -- a very low-key, very religious. You're a brash New Yorker.

DONALD TRUMP: Religious.

LESLIE STAHL: Religious?

DONALD TRUMP: Religious.

LESLIE STAHL: Are you?

DONALD TRUMP: Yeah, religious. Hey, I won the evangelicals. The evangelicals...

LESLIE STAHL: But that doesn't mean...

DONALD TRUMP: Nobody thought -- well, I think it means a lot. I don't think they think I'm perfect, and they would get up and they'd say, you know, he's not perfect. But they like me.

LESLIE STAHL: They would point to the divorces.

DONALD TRUMP: But I won. I won states with the evangelicals that nobody thought I'd even come close to winning. I won with a landslide.

LESLIE STAHL: That's true. So, you didn't need him for the evangelicals?

DONALD TRUMP: I think it helps. But I don't think I needed him, no. Because I won with the evangelicals.

MIKE PENCE: But I -- I think we have more in common...

LESLIE STAHL: Yeah. Tell me what you think have in common?

MIKE PENCE: ... than might be immediately obvious.

LESLIE STAHL: Beside issues. Values and things like that.

DONALD TRUMP: I think we will very, very good chemistry. I feel that. And I can feel that pretty early on.

I don't think you need to be with somebody for two years to find that out. My feeling is...

LESLIE STAHL: Your gut feeling?

DONALD TRUMP: Don't -- I knew during the primaries, during many trips to Indiana, I'd be with him. I think we have a great chemistry.

LESLIE STAHL: I want to ask you, though, about something you've said about negative campaigning.

MIKE PENCE: Yeah.

LESLIE STAHL: You've said, "Negative campaigning is wrong. And a campaign ought to demonstrate the basic decency of the candidate." With that in mind, what do you think about your running mate's campaign, and the tone and the negativity of it?

MIKE PENCE: I think this is a good man who has been talking about the issues the American people care about.

LESLIE STAHL: But name calling? Lyin' Ted?

MIKE PENCE: In -- in the essay that I wrote a long time ago...

LESLIE STAHL: Yeah.

MIKE PENCE: I said campaigns ought to be about something more important than just one candidate's election. And -- and this campaign and Donald Trump's candidacy has been about the issues the American people care about.

DONALD TRUMP: Listen, listen.

LESLIE STAHL: But what about the negative side? He apologized for being a negative candidate.

DONALD TRUMP: We're different people. I understand that. I'll give you an example.

Hillary Clinton is a liar. Hillary Clinton -- it was just proven last week.

LESLIE STAHL: That's -- that's negative, by the way.

DONALD TRUMP: Hillary Clinton -- you're going to believe it. Hillary Clinton is crook.

LESLIE STAHL: That's negative.

DONALD TRUMP: I call her Crooked Hillary. She's Crooked Hillary.

He won't -- I don't -- I didn't ask him to do it. But I don't think he should do it, because it's different for him.

LESLIE STAHL: But I -- he's...

DONALD TRUMP: He's not that kind of a person. We're different people.

LESLIE STAHL: He's probably...

DONALD TRUMP: To me, she's Crooked Hillary.

LESLIE STAHL: Don't you think that's wrong?

DONALD TRUMP: I don't think he should use that term. I've never said, one way or the other. But to him, I don't think it would sound right, but he will say how dishonest she is by going over the fence.

LESLIE STAHL: But would you go to him -- let's say you won. You're the vice president, your office is, I assume, down the hall. And you go in and you say, you know, you shouldn't saying -- name calling.

Would you do that? Would go in and say, you crossed the line. I think you should apologize. Would you do something like that?

MIKE PENCE: Look -- look, it's...

LESLIE STAHL: He's laughing.

MIKE PENCE: It's probably...

DONALD TRUMP: I don't know. It's OK.

MIKE PENCE: It's -- it's probably obviously to people that our styles are different.

But I promise you, our vision is exactly the same.

LESLIE STAHL: No, but would you -- let me...

MIKE PENCE: And let me be clear.

LESLIE STAHL: Can -- will you answer that? Would you go in?

MIKE PENCE: Well, the -- one of the things that I found out about this man is he appreciates candor.

LESLIE STAHL: So you would go in?

MIKE PENCE: You know, I...

DONALD TRUMP: I'd like him to, if he thinks I was doing something wrong.

LESLIE STAHL: Would you listen to him if he said you crossed the line?

DONALD TRUMP: Absolutely, absolutely. I might not apologize; you know, said apologize. But...

LESLIE STAHL: I did say apologize.

DONALD TRUMP: But -- might not do that. But I would absolutely want him to come in.

MIKE PENCE: Sure.

DONALD TRUMP: If he thinks I'm doing something wrong -- Mike, I would want him to come in and say...

MIKE PENCE: Right.

DONALD TRUMP: ... really, you're doing, you've got to -- and that's OK.

I accept that from my consultants and my people. And if Mike came in and told me, you know, I think you should do this or that, I would listen.

LESLIE STAHL: Back off that?

DONALD TRUMP: And very likely listen to him.

LESLIE STAHL: Do you think John McCain was not a hero because he was captured?

MIKE PENCE: I have a great of respect for John McCain (INAUDIBLE).

LESLIE STAHL: Do you think he went too far?

DONALD TRUMP: You -- you could yes. I -- that's OK. On that one, you could say yes, I mean, you know, that's fine.

Hey look, I like John McCain. But we have to take care of others.

LESLIE STAHL: Yeah, but I want to know if Mr. Pence would go in an say to you, what did you...

DONALD TRUMP: That's why not that many people are upset.

LESLIE STAHL: ... what did you say? You know, would you do something like that?

MIKE PENCE: I -- I promise you that when the circumstances arise where I have a difference on policy, or on presentation, I -- I have, I can tell you in my heart, I know -- I would have no hesitation, were I privileged to be vice president, to walk into the president's office, close the door and share my heart.

And I also know this good man would listen and has -- and has the leadership qualities to draw from the people around him.

LESLIE STAHL: Let's talk about some of the issues, because there seems to be some daylight between you two. And we can just tick -- go quickly through these.

Immigration. Mr. Trump, you have called for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States. Do you agree with that?

MIKE PENCE: I do. In fact, in Indiana, we suspended the Syrian refugee program in the -- in the wake of a terrorist attack.

We have no higher priority than the safety and security of the people of this country. And Donald Trump is right to articulate that to you.

LESLIE STAHL: In December -- in December, you tweeted, and I quote you, "Calls to ban Muslims from entering the U.S. are offensive and unconstitutional."

DONALD TRUMP: So you call it territories. OK? We're going to do territories. We're going to not let people come in from Syria that nobody knows who they are.

Hillary Clinton wants 550 percent more people to come in than Obama, who doesn't know what he's...

LESLIE STAHL: So you -- so, are you changing your position?

DONALD TRUMP: So, we're going to -- no, I -- call it whatever you want. We'll call it territories, OK?

LESLIE STAHL: So, not Muslims?

DONALD TRUMP: The Constitution -- there's nothing like it. But it doesn't necessarily give us the right to commit suicide as a country. OK?

And I'll tell you this. Call it whatever you want, change territories, but there are territories and terror states and terror nations that we're not going to allow the people to come in to our country.

And we're going to have a thing called extreme vetting. And if people want to come in, they're going to be extreme vetting. We're going to have extreme vetting.

They're going to come in and we're going to know where they came from and who they are.

LESLIE STAHL: I wanted to tick through these, but we're going down...

MIKE PENCE: You just asked me if I'm comfortable with that, and I am.

What -- what Donald...

(CROSSTALK)

LESLIE STAHL: You're on the same page on that?

MIKE PENCE: This clearly -- clearly, this man is not a politician. He doesn't speak like a politician.

LESLIE STAHL: He has done pretty well.

MIKE PENCE: He speaks from his heart.

DONALD TRUMP: I think that's a good thing.

MIKE PENCE: He speaks from from his heart. And...

DONALD TRUMP: Well, I think I speak from my heart and my brain, just so we understand. People speak from their heart.

(LAUGHTER)

MIKE PENCE: Right.

DONALD TRUMP: But this is maybe more important.

LESLIE STAHL: Let's go to trade.

You have voted for every trade agreement when you were in Congress that came before you.

MIKE PENCE: I have.

LESLIE STAHL: You're supporting the Transpacific Partnership that Mr. Trump says "Would rape this country."

Now, are you going to be able to go out and campaign in support of his protectionist positions?

MIKE PENCE: Well, I -- I support free trade, and so does Donald Trump.

LESLIE STAHL: Not really.

(CROSSTALK)

DONALD TRUMP: I do. On free trade. But I want to make good deals.

No, no. I'm all for free trade.

LESLIE STAHL: You talk about...

DONALD TRUMP: You know, I'm not an isolationist. A lot of people think, because I want to make good deals. These are stupid people.

LESLIE STAHL: You want to undo these agreements.

DONALD TRUMP: Wait a minute, Lesley. These are stupid people that think that.

I want to make great deals for our country. We have deals -- like the bill signed by Bill Clinton, NAFTA, one of the worst things that ever happened to this country in terms of trade, in terms of economics.

LESLIE STAHL: What do you think about NAFTA?

MIKE PENCE: You're absolutely right. I've supported free trade throughout my career.

LESLIE STAHL: OK.

MIKE PENCE: But the truth of the matter is, NAFTA has provisions in that law that call for it to be reviewed that have never been -- never been initiated. What -- what I hear Donald Trump saying is let's -- let's look at these trade agreements and reconsider them and renegotiate them. And...

LESLIE STAHL: And you're OK with that?

MIKE PENCE: And with regard to other trade agreements, we've talked about this. I really do believe when the American people elect one of the best negotiators in the world as president of the United States, we would do well...

DONALD TRUMP: We're going to bring back our jobs.

MIKE PENCE: ... to negotiate individually with countries.

DONALD TRUMP: We're going to bring back our jobs, we're going to bring back our wealth, we're going to take care of our people. Very simple.

LESLIE STAHL: OK. More issues. Waterboarding. Mr. Trump wants to bring back waterboarding, quote, "a hell of a lot more." Are you comfortable with bringing back waterboarding?

MIKE PENCE: I don't think we should ever tell our enemy what our tactics are.

LESLIE STAHL: But what about that? What about...

MIKE PENCE: I don't...

LESLIE STAHL: He's publicly said that...

DONALD TRUMP: I like that answer.

MIKE PENCE: I don't think we should -- I -- I think...

LESLIE STAHL: But are you OK with the idea of waterboarding?

MIKE PENCE: I think -- I think enhanced interrogation saved lives.

LESLIE STAHL: And you're OK with that?

MIKE PENCE: What I'm OK with -- what I'm OK with is protecting the American people. What I'm OK with is when people have the intent to come to this country and take American lives, that -- that we are -- that -- that we are prepared to do what's necessary to gain the information to protect the people of this country.

DONALD TRUMP: But Lesley, let's step further. We have an enemy, ISIS and others, who chop off heads, who drown people in steel cages and we can't do waterboarding.

LESLIE STAHL: OK, but, but why...

DONALD TRUMP: OK, they're not playing...

LESLIE STAHL: ... would you use their techniques?

DONALD TRUMP: Because you know what, those techniques get information. I don't care what anyone says.

LESLIE STAHL: Are you agreeing with him?

MIKE PENCE: I am not...

DONALD TRUMP: You get information using those things.

MIKE PENCE: What I can tell you is enhanced interrogation gleaned information that saved American lives, and I was informed, prevented incoming terrorist attacks on this country from being successful. The American people expect the president of the United States to be prepared to support action to protect the people of this nation, and I know Donald Trump will.

LESLIE STAHL: Have you answered me?

MIKE PENCE: I have.

LESLIE STAHL: Let's talk about the convention. You're a showman. What are you going to do to keep it from being a snooze-o-rama, as some of them have been?

DONALD TRUMP: Well, I think we're going to have an exciting time. We've got some wonderful speakers. We have some very talented people. My family's going to speak.

LESLIE STAHL: Worried about violence outside? This is an open-carry state. People can carry guns. There'll be demonstrators. They've already said they're going to carry assault rifles. Are you worried? And would you call on people not to carry their guns?

DONALD TRUMP: I have great faith in law enforcement. If they don't want to take their guns, I think that's fantastic. But I have great confidence in law enforcement. The police like Donald Trump. It's law and order. And I have great confidence that they will do a great job.

LESLIE STAHL: There's no question in anybody's mind that you want to win this election. I don't think anyone would doubt that. But what about being president? Do you really want to be president of the United States?

DONALD TRUMP: I want to make America great again. Honestly. I want to make -- I'm not doing this because -- I mean, I'm sacrificing tremendous things. I could be doing other things. It's lovely to sit down with you and be grilled. That's OK. But I could be doing other things right now. And I have some of the greatest properties in the world. I could be out there...

LESLIE STAHL: Would you rather be out there?

DONALD TRUMP: I'll tell you what. I've really enjoyed this process. I've gotten to know the people of this country. I've gotten to know places that I didn't know, that I read about, but I didn't know. I've also gotten to see the problems. And it's a movement. Now, when you ask me the question, do I want to be?

LESLIE STAHL: Yeah.

DONALD TRUMP: I want to be for one reason. I want to make America safe again, and I want to make America great again. That's why I'm doing this. And I love it.

LESLIE STAHL: And you want to govern? I mean it...

DONALD TRUMP: I do want to govern.

LESLIE STAHL: It is different building a movement...

DONALD TRUMP: I do -- I govern my -- I...

LESLIE STAHL: And then going in there with the nitty-gritty and all that tough decision making.

DONALD TRUMP: Sure. No, no I want to govern.

LESLIE STAHL: OK, this is my absolute final question.

DONALD TRUMP: OK.

LESLIE STAHL: You're not known to be a humble man. But I wonder...

DONALD TRUMP: I think I am, actually, humble. I think I'm much more humble than you would understand.

LESLIE STAHL: As you think about the prospect of running this country in these tough times where the world is spinning apart -- are you awed? Are you intimidated? Are you humbled by the enormity of this?

DONALD TRUMP: You just said it best.

MIKE PENCE: Mmm.

DONALD TRUMP: In a world that's spinning apart. That's what I'm thinking of. I'm not thinking of, oh gee, isn't this wonderful? Isn't this great, what I've done? I've had people that said, it doesn't matter if you win or lose, what you've done has never been done before. You're going to go down in the history books.

You know what I say to 'em? I say, you're wrong. I will consider it, 'cause I funded my own primaries, I'm funding now a lot of this campaign. I'm putting in -- you know, I've spent $55 million in the primaries. I'm spending a fortunate now. I'll tell you, it is spinning. Our world is spinning out of control. Our country's spinning out of control. That's what I think about. And I'll stop that.

LESLIE STAHL: You're not -- humbled or -- awe?

MIKE PENCE: I can say to you -- what...

LESLIE STAHL: Go ahead.

MIKE PENCE: Talking with him in private settings, I love the words you used because this man is awed with the American people and he is not intimidated by the world. And Donald Trump, this good man, I believe, will be a great president of the United States.

DONALD TRUMP: I love what he just said.

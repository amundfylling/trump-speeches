DONALD TRUMP: If somebody things bad things are going on, you have to report it. That should not be racial profiling. And they thought something bad was going on and they did not report it. Not good.

UNIDENTIFIED: Can you elaborate a little bit on your comments about racial profiling?

DONALD TRUMP: No. There is nothing to elaborate. I think you're in the way of your camera, by the way. You OK? Trying to make him look good. Right? No, the story was that they did not want to racially profile. In the meantime, a lot of people got killed. We have to use common sense, OK?

UNIDENTIFIED: Both the people in the shooting were regular people, it seemed like, with kids. They didn't seem --

DONALD TRUMP: What people are we talking about?

UNIDENTIFIED: The husband and wife. They --

(CROSSTALK)

DONALD TRUMP: You mean the people that were the killers?

UNIDENTIFIED: The killers. They were just normal people with a kid, they went to work. They were unsuspected. What --

(CROSSTALK)

DONALD TRUMP: I don't know if they were regular people. I heard the apartment was loaded up with bombs and with guns and --

UNIDENTIFIED: But nobody could have ever seen that was the case. What would you do --

DONALD TRUMP: I don't know. When you have pipe bombs lying all over the floor, I don't think they're regular people. When you have pipe bombs all over the floor, so I do not think they're regular people.

(CROSSTALK)

Where's your camera, by the way?

UNIDENTIFIED: Right there.

DONALD TRUMP: It has a microphone in it.

(CROSSTALK)

UNIDENTIFIED: -- what do you think should be done differently --

(CROSSTALK)

DONALD TRUMP: Again, there were people that knew bad things were going on. People knew that bad things were going on and they didn't report it because of racial profiling. But I don't think they were regular people. To me, they're not regular people. To me, they were criminals. And it's too bad that somebody didn't find out about it sooner.

UNIDENTIFIED: Mr. Trump, what are your thoughts on "The New York Times" editorial today on the guns --

(CROSSTALK)

DONALD TRUMP: On guns?

UNIDENTIFIED: Yes.

DONALD TRUMP: Well, I feel very strongly that people in this country and actually the world need protect. If you look at Paris, they didn't have guns. And they were slaughtered. If you look at what happened in California, they didn't have guns. They were slaughtered. So I think it would have been better if they had guns in that room, somebody to protect. They could have protected themselves if they had guns.

This is a war. We're in a war. And if we're not smart and if we're not really cunning, and if we don't beat them to the punch, it's going to be very ugly over here. It's going to be very bad.

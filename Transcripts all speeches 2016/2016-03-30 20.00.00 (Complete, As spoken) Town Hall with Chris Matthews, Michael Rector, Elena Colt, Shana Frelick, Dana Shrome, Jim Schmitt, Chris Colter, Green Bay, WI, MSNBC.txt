CHRIS MATTHEWS: Good evening. And welcome to this exclusive town hall.

Tonight, for a full hour, our guest is the front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination, Donald Trump.

(APPLAUSE)

DONALD TRUMP: Thank you.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Donald Trump, interesting situation here.

We're up here in Green Bay.

DONALD TRUMP: Right.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: And my -- and my calculations say, that if you're going to win the general election, you have got to win up here, states like Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, NFL places.

DONALD TRUMP: Sure.

(LAUGHTER)

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Right?

DONALD TRUMP: I think -- you know, it would certainly be helpful. We're doing very well, and we're leading by a lot, we're leading everybody by a lot. And in votes, in terms of votes, we're millions of votes up on Cruz and millions of votes up on Kasich.

But we'll have to see what we do. I mean, all you can do is do your best, right, folks? We do our best.

(APPLAUSE)

CHRIS MATTHEWS: But let's talk about -- before you go to the general election, you've got to win the Republican nomination. What is -- what is your leverage there?

You've talked about North -- North Asia, North Atlantic Treaty, the Middle East, Mexico, the ability to walk, the ability to say, no more trade. The ability to say, we're not going to buy your oil.

It's always leverage, it's always, "I'm going to walk."

What is your leverage with Republican bosses when you get to Cleveland, when they try to keep you from winning the nomination on the first ballot?

DONALD TRUMP: Well, one thing -- the voters. I have millions more votes than anybody else. It's not even close. You know, because you have reported on it. We're setting records in terms of Republican primaries.

If you look at New Hampshire, if you look at South Carolina, no matter where you look, we're setting records.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Right.

DONALD TRUMP: And that's my leverage. And these are people that are really -- they really like Donald Trump, they really like what I'm saying. And people -- we're going to make America great again, that's what it is.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Right.

DONALD TRUMP: And that's what my leverage is.

Now, without me, they lose millions of -- I think millions of people, and nobody is going to have a chance. I will beat Hillary Clinton. And I haven't started that process yet.

I have two people left. We started off with actually 18 people.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Right.

DONALD TRUMP: And now, there is two left.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: You're counting Jim Gilmore?

DONALD TRUMP: I'm counting Jim. Sort of counting, sort of counting.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: OK, let me ask you about the steps you've got. Cleveland is going to be in July. If you could win there short of 1,230 -- if you get to 1,237, you've got it.

DONALD TRUMP: Right.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: If you come in short, and they try something on the first ballot -- now, I've been watching, listening. Mitt Romney is up to something, he wants it, you can tell he wants it.

Paul Ryan is making himself very clearly available with the statement he made last week. What do you do, if they deny you the first ballot victory?

DONALD TRUMP: Well, we're going to see what happens. I can say this, Chris: we're so far up above everybody else. We're hundreds of -- I mean, hundreds of delegates above Cruz.

We just -- you probably heard last night, Missouri was just certified, so I won Missouri in addition to everything else.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Yes.

DONALD TRUMP: We're way, way up in votes, way, way up -- if we're a little bit short, I think it's a very unfair process. Let me just explain...

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Well, what's the jimmy? Six inches, two feet?

DONALD TRUMP: Well, let me just explain something. Well, let me explain. Normally, you talk about running, and you don't have 17 people.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Yeah.

DONALD TRUMP: We had 17 people, we actually had 18 people, again, including Gilmore, OK?

So, we have 18 people. And during a long period of time, we'd have 14 people, 13 people, 12 people, you know, in primaries. We had a lot of people in the primaries.

So, I'd get 25 percent, 28 percent -- those are phenomenal numbers when you have that many people running. So, in those early states -- which I won, but you can't get 50 percent when you have that many people running. There has never been so many people running.

I'm going to come very close to the 1,237. I think I'm going to beat the 1,237. We're doing phenomenally in New York.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Yes.

DONALD TRUMP: You probably saw the poll that just came out in New York, Emerson College, which is a -- you know, I'm up by --

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Yes, but it's all about you're not getting the 1,237. They'll deny it to you.

DONALD TRUMP: Yes, I know, I know, I know. We just -- all you can do --

CHRIS MATTHEWS: What are you going to do -- are you going to be Teddy Roosevelt?

You mentioned a couple of days ago, you liked Teddy Roosevelt. In 1912, he didn't get the nomination. He walked out, split the party, beat the Republican Party in November, but lost the general to Wilson.

DONALD TRUMP: Yes. I can't tell you what I'm going to yet, because I'm not sure I know. I have to see. I hope they're going to be fair. If they're going to be fair, they're going to be very happy.

How can they give up millions of people that really feel disenfranchised, except for --

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Because they don't like you, they don't want you to be the nominee.

DONALD TRUMP: Well, that's true. But then, they're going to lose and then you're going to have four Supreme Court justices that they're not going to like.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: OK. You said last night on CNN, you're not going to stick to this pledge to back the nominee. Is that -- are you sticking to that?

DONALD TRUMP: Well, no. I have not been treated properly. People understand. They haven't stuck to the pledge. I don't want an endorsement from somebody that doesn't feel like, oh, I love Trump. If he wins, he's going to be the guy.

I don't want that endorsement. I'm not looking for that endorsement.

So when they ask me about Cruz and the endorsement, I said, no, no. Just put -- no pressure on Cruz, tell him he doesn't have to endorse me. Please don't endorse me.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Right.

DONALD TRUMP: It doesn't matter. The endorsements don't mean very much. You know, I have great endorsements. I have some phenomenal endorsements.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Yes.

DONALD TRUMP: I have Senator Sessions, Jeff Sessions, endorse me, everybody thought he was going to endorse Cruz. He endorsed me because he knows I'm much better on security. I'm better on a lot of things.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: I watched you, Mr. Trump, on every issue, and you always talk about leverage. You always talk we can walk away from a deal with the Saudis on oil, we can walk away with the Chinese, we don't have to buy their stuff anymore, we don't have to pay for our troops in Europe if they don't want to do it.

You always say your leverage is the ability to walk. Do you have the ability to walk with the Republican nomination?

DONALD TRUMP: I think --

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Can you walk?

DONALD TRUMP: Of course. I can always do that. I can always walk. I don't want to -- I don't want to let people down. I have millions of people more than Cruz has. I have millions of people.

Now, the system is not a good system. When you take Louisiana -- I went to Louisiana, I campaigned -- I campaigned there. I won the state.

Now, the numbers come out and I have less delegates than Cruz. That's not the American way.

I went out -- as you know, I won Louisiana. Big victory, everything great. But because of arcane rules and a lot of nonsense, frankly, I get -- I end up getting a few less delegates than Cruz. That's not the way the system is supposed to work. It's not the way --

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Well, three-fifths of the American people in the latest poll we got at NBC say that you're right, if you have the most votes, you should be the nominee. I'm still trying to figure out what your alternative is if you don't get it. What do you do?

DONALD TRUMP: Look, look. I don't think I'd want to tell you as much as I respect you. You know, I did an interview with -- Chris, at the University of Pennsylvania many, many years ago. We had --

CHRIS MATTHEWS: This stuff doesn't work with me. If you got -- it came out --

DONALD TRUMP: But is that a true thing? In fact --

(CROSSTALK)

CHRIS MATTHEWS: It's all true, and you were a celebrity even then.

DONALD TRUMP: I was a celebrity, yes.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Let's talk about something, the 800-pound gorilla.

DONALD TRUMP: I mean, we have to -- I do like your question on leverage. My leverage is the voters, Chris, just to end it. My leverage is the voters. I have millions more votes than anybody else.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Was Teddy Roosevelt right to walk?

DONALD TRUMP: I studied well. I think possibly he was, but boy, did that cause a problem.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: It sure did.

Let me ask you about this thing the other day with your campaign manager. Do you think you could have handled it differently from our -- from the start with maybe an apology to the young women reporter, something like that? Maybe give her an interview?

DONALD TRUMP: Yes. Personally...

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Something to de-escalate the issue and show respect for her. Could you have done that more?

DONALD TRUMP: No, I don't think so. I think if she called up to apologize, I think you'd be in the exact same place, and people that have seen that tape are going, give me a break. You have to be kidding.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: But there was contact.

DONALD TRUMP: What contact? I mean, there's contact every time --

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Well, that's what this law says. It's unwanted touching, unwanted --

DONALD TRUMP: Hey, look. I'm walking with reporters -- I'm walking and she contacted me.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: It's simple battery.

(CROSSTALK)

DONALD TRUMP: Excuse me. She grabbed my arm twice. You see the picture of me looking like, who is this person, and getting her off.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: What do you make of the bruises on the picture?

DONALD TRUMP: I don't know who created those bruises. I really don't know. I mean, you know, two days later, she comes in and she said she had some bruises. I don't --

CHRIS MATTHEWS: But this kind of argument just infuriates her and a lot of women because you're not showing belief in her credibility.

DONALD TRUMP: I just gave --

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Why would she make up a story about bruises? Why would anybody do that?

DONALD TRUMP: You know what? Fifteen minutes away, in front of a very large crowd, I gave a speech, and we talked about that. And I said, who saw the tape, and everybody raised -- almost -- a lot of people raised their hand. I'd say three-quarters raised their hands. Big audience.

I said, who thinks he did something really wrong? I said stand up please, or raise your hand if you don't want to stand up. Not one person in the room -- your cameras were there -- not one person in the room raised their hand.

We're getting -- it's out of control, political correctness, whatever you want to call it, it's totally out of control.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: What's the right approach, though? If you -- if you accidentally bump into somebody, accidentally trip them, you say I'm sorry. Don't you show some apology and respect for the other person?

DONALD TRUMP: Yes, I think that's fine. I mean, I think that's fine.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Wouldn't that be appropriate here?

DONALD TRUMP: I'm not sure he didn't maybe even say it there. What he was doing is -- in my opinion just in watching the tape, because nobody even remembers the incident because it was so minor, it's not like the -- you --

CHRIS MATTHEWS: The Jupiter Police remember it.

DONALD TRUMP: That -- excuse me. I think that they are -- what they've done is, I think, outrageous. They're destroying a very good person. He's a good person. Forget about politics, he's a good person with a wonderful family, four beautiful kids, and they're destroying that man over nothing.

You take a look at that tape, and she's grabbing me. Now maybe I should press charges against her; she's not supposed to be grabbing me. She's touching me, she's grabbing my arm and I'm going like this, I'm saying who is it?

You know, the news conference was over, she wasn't supposed to be asking questions. She pushed her way through, came through the Secret Service, grabs my arm, and I think maybe this was just -- and let me tell you something, just so you understand. If she went down -- you know, she made the statement that she went down or essentially almost went down --

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Almost went down.

DONALD TRUMP: Nothing -- there was nothing there. She didn't even have -- if I give you a little shot on the arm, you're going to go "Oww!" I'm a strong guy. You're going to go, "Oh!" You're going to have some kind of a facial -- she didn't even have facial movement.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: But she did say in real time that it hurt and she wanted to know who did it.

DONALD TRUMP: I don't know when was a real time? When did they record that? I don't know. When did they record that?

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Well, you're really skeptical about her.

DONALD TRUMP: I'm a very skeptical person about her, yes.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: And why don't you have any sympathy for her?

DONALD TRUMP: I don't think that -- look, for --

CHRIS MATTHEWS: She's doing her job.

DONALD TRUMP: First of all, it was my tape. You know I was the one that did the tape.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: I know it's -- that was your tape.

DONALD TRUMP: And I looked at that tape, and we have heads being cut off in -- all over the world, frankly, but we have people's heads being cut off in the Middle East, people's heads being cut off. We have people drowning in steel cages. Here's a woman -- and it didn't even look like there was physical touch, and that was almost like he was just blocking her away from me, and he's supposed to be a criminal for that?

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Yes. But we're -- but Western society claims that we're better with women.

DONALD TRUMP: Look, nobody respects women more than I do, that I can tell you.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: You don't respect her, though.

DONALD TRUMP: And nobody -- well, you know, she's somebody that -- yes, I would say I don't have great respect for her. I think for her to do what she did to this man over what he did is outrageous, is outrageous.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Well, she quit her job over it, she must believe in her story.

DONALD TRUMP: Did she quit or did she get fired?

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Well, I don't know. Let me -- I think she quit. I think she quit.

DONALD TRUMP: OK. Well, you think -- you do? I think maybe the other way. You'll find that, we'll find out in court.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Let's talk about the larger --

DONALD TRUMP: Chris, you know what? We'll find out in court. The easiest thing for me to do, you're fired. That's so easy, that's a very easy expression.

(LAUGHTER)

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Yes.

DONALD TRUMP: And then everybody's happy --

(APPLAUSE)

Everybody's happy.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Well, there's a middle group, but that --

DONALD TRUMP: But you know what? I can't -- I can't do that because I'm loyal to people. And you know, when they went to Cruz and Kasich, oh, you should fire him, they didn't even see the tape I don't think. You should fire him, you should fire him. I don't do that.

If somebody is being -- really, I just thought it was a very unfair situation. This is not good for me, OK?

CHRIS MATTHEWS: How do you think women react when they see this?

DONALD TRUMP: I think a lot of --

CHRIS MATTHEWS: The numbers aren't good.

DONALD TRUMP: I think a lot of women would say give me a break. I don't -- I don't understand why. I mean, the numbers aren't good. The numbers were good. The numbers aren't as good with women as they were. But nobody respects women more than I do.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Let's talk about ISIS. It's the number one concern of a lot of people since last week.

DONALD TRUMP: Right.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: How do you beat people -- now, when we fought the Germans or the Italians and, you know, the army puts their hands up at the end because they know it's hopeless.

DONALD TRUMP: Right.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: How do you fight --

DONALD TRUMP: It's called uniforms.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: And how do you fight people who wrap themselves in dynamite? They get up, brush their teeth in the morning, shave I suppose in some cases, they go off to the airport with the idea of blowing themselves up, killing themselves that day, that morning. How do you beat an army like that, because this gets down to something that we haven't dealt with before in our history? How do we beat that kind of mentality?

DONALD TRUMP: We have to be so tough and so vigilant, and we have to do things, frankly, that we've never done before.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: But they want to die for their cause.

DONALD TRUMP: Maybe they do, and some of them do. And I -- you know, a lot of people are trying to figure out why they do this, how they do this.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: They're recruited.

DONALD TRUMP: Are they drugged out? Tell me.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: They're recruited.

DONALD TRUMP: Are they drugged out when they do it? What's going on when they walk in and they blow themselves up? Are they all drugged out? Is somebody drugging them? There's a lot of things going on.

And you know, when I talked about we have to be very careful because we have people coming into this country, it's a very bad situation. We have thousands and thousands of people coming into our country. We have no idea where they come from, who they are.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: But oftentimes, it's the second or first generation. It's not the first wave of immigrants. These people in Belgium had been living there. They were born there. They're Belgians.

And so, how do you deal with that situation?

DONALD TRUMP: Well, look at the guys in Boston, the Boston bomber. They came here as young kids --

CHRIS MATTHEWS: They were here -- they were -- so what do you with -- OK. OK.

DONALD TRUMP: -- and they became radicalized.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Does banning their entry into the country, even temporarily, encourage them to be on our side against the terrorists or encourages them to be on the other side?

DONALD TRUMP: I think banning -- I think banning until we figure out what's going on is an important thing. And I take a lot of heat for it and a lot of people like me for it, to be honest with you.

But, Chris, there's something going on.

(CROSSTALK)

CHRIS MATTHEWS: But there's 1.6 billion Muslims in the world. And they're all getting the message from Donald Trump, who's leading the fight for the Republican nomination for president, saying, "Stay out of my country."

How does that encourage them to fight ISIS?

DONALD TRUMP: Chris --

CHRIS MATTHEWS: How does that encourage them to fight the bad guys?

DONALD TRUMP: OK, let me -- they have a problem too. They have a big problem.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: But if we say "Go away " --

DONALD TRUMP: I have been told by more Muslims who are saying, "What are you doing is a great thing, not a bad thing."

The two people in San Bernardino --

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Are any Muslims telling you that?

DONALD TRUMP: I have actually -- believe it or not, I have a lot of friends that are Muslim and they call me.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Right.

DONALD TRUMP: In most cases, they're very rich Muslims, OK?

CHRIS MATTHEWS: But do they get in the country?

DONALD TRUMP: But they do call me.

They'll come in.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: How do you let them in?

DONALD TRUMP: They'll come in. And you'll have exceptions.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: But you --

DONALD TRUMP: Wait, wait, wait.

Look, Chris, Chris, with the San Bernardino situation --

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Right.

DONALD TRUMP: -- many people saw that apartment with bombs all over the apartment.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Yes, I agree with that.

DONALD TRUMP: Bombs on table.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: You see something, say something.

DONALD TRUMP: Not one person --

CHRIS MATTHEWS: I know.

DONALD TRUMP: -- with all the people that said -- they said it's racial profiling. That's why they didn't call.

You know why they said that? Because some lawyer said, "You know, you saw this, you better come up with a good excuse." They said it's racial profiling.

A lot of people saw what was going on in that apartment. Not one Muslim, OK?

CHRIS MATTHEWS: I'm with you on this. Of course I'm with you.

But that's not the question.

DONALD TRUMP: OK. Why didn't they report 'em?

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Look, look, you're saying ban --

DONALD TRUMP: In other words, why -- but Chris, why don't they report 'em?

CHRIS MATTHEWS: OK. You say ban them from entering the country. They get the message. Everyone in the world -- over 1.6 -- in Indonesia, Pakistan, everywhere, in Albania. Anywhere there's Muslims, you know, they know you don't want them. So they get the message.

They're a little more ill-disposed to fight ISIS, a little bit more after that once they say, "The Americans don't even like us, " don't you think?

DONALD TRUMP: I don't know, maybe they'll be more disposed to fight ISIS. Maybe they'll say, "We want to come back into America, we've got to solve this problem."

CHRIS MATTHEWS: OK.

DONALD TRUMP: I'm serious about that. Maybe they'll be --

CHRIS MATTHEWS: OK. Cruz, your guy.

Do you know what Cruz is pushing more? He wants patrol cars driving up neighborhoods that he thinks are Islam -- Muslim people living there, looking into windows for plotting.

I mean, it's an insane idea. These aren't street criminals. They're plotting bombings, if they are, and they're getting -- "Oh, we're going to go up and down the street." That'll make them more militant against us.

DONALD TRUMP: Well, he's toughening up his stance because my stance has been very tough and --

CHRIS MATTHEWS: What do you think of his stance? Patrol cars?

DONALD TRUMP: I think we have to look at the mosques. I think we have to be extremely careful. We have to look at mosques.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: We're making enemies here.

DONALD TRUMP: A lot of things -- we're making enemies by doing nothing. I mean, we're knocking down World Trade Centers. We're shooting planes into the Pentagon.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Yes.

DONALD TRUMP: Probably the other plane was going towards the White House. You have some very brave people.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: All right.

DONALD TRUMP: But, you know, what are we going to do, just sit back and say we want to be nice to everybody? We can't be so nice.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Yes, but sometimes we create more trouble than we went into. Do you think it was smart to go into Iraq?

DONALD TRUMP: A very complicated --

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Was that smart to put our troops in the Holy Land of Mecca?

DONALD TRUMP: I thought it was one of the -- I thought it was one of the worst decisions in the history of our country. And I was against it from the beginning.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: I know.

Are you more hawkish than Hillary or less hawkish?

DONALD TRUMP: I'm probably more intelligent than Hillary.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Oh, come on, answer the question.

(LAUGHTER)

Are you more hawkish?

(APPLAUSE)

DONALD TRUMP: I want to...

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Are you more likely to engage militarily than Hillary?

DONALD TRUMP: Here's what I want to do: I would never want to make a blanket statement like that, because, you know, you have different -- I would have never gone into Iraq. And I said from a very early date -- and you saw that.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: I know.

DONALD TRUMP: From the earliest date, "I don't want to go into Iraq. Don't go into Iraq."

Now, I was a real estate guy, I was a business guy. So, nobody really cared that much. But there were articles long time ago. I said, "You're going to destabilize the Middle East." That happened.

Now, when we got out of Iraq, we got out the wrong way. We set a date, which was terrible. We should have left some soldiers back. And I always said, "Take the oil, " because you know who has the oil right now?

CHRIS MATTHEWS: You need ground troops to do that.

DONALD TRUMP: First of all, Iran is getting the oil.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: You need ground troops to take the oil.

DONALD TRUMP: I said, "Take the oil."

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Ground troops --

DONALD TRUMP: Now, Libya -- well, I said, "Keep the oil." We -- we already had the troops there. When we were leaving, I said, "Don't leave. Keep the oil."

CHRIS MATTHEWS: OK.

Your most controversial suggestion was don't take nuclear weapons -- I mean, you may have been hooked into this by pressing question --

DONALD TRUMP: Don't take what?

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Nuclear weapons off the table.

I have been trying to think of how we could conceivably use a nuclear weapon in the Middle East or in Europe in fighting ISIS. Where can you -- and why put it on the table or leave it on the table if you can't imagine where to use it?

DONALD TRUMP: Well, I didn't say, "Don't take it." I said I would be very, very slow and hesitant to pull that trigger.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Well, why would you -- why wouldn't you just say, "I don't want to talk about it. I don't want to talk about nuclear weapons. Presidents don't talk about use of nuclear weapons"?

DONALD TRUMP: The question was asked -- we were talking about NATO -- which, by the way, I say is obsolete and we pay a dis --

CHRIS MATTHEWS: But you got hooked into something you shouldn't have talked about.

DONALD TRUMP: I don't think I -- well, someday, maybe.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: When? Maybe?

DONALD TRUMP: Of course. If somebody --

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Where would we drop -- where would we drop a nuclear weapon in the Middle East?

DONALD TRUMP: Let me explain. Let me explain.

Somebody hits us within ISIS -- you wouldn't fight back with a nuke?

CHRIS MATTHEWS: No. To drop a nuclear weapon on a community of people that are --

DONALD TRUMP: No, no, but you can't say -- first of all, you don't want to say, "Take everything off the table... "

CHRIS MATTHEWS: No, just nuclear.

DONALD TRUMP: -- because you'd be a bad negotiator if you do that.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Just nuclear.

DONALD TRUMP: Look, nuclear should be off the table. But would there be a time when it could be used, possibly, possibly?

CHRIS MATTHEWS: OK. The trouble is, when you said that, the whole world heard it. David Cameron in Britain heard it. The Japanese, where we bombed them in '45, heard it. They're hearing a guy running for president of the United States talking of maybe using nuclear weapons. Nobody wants to hear that about an American president.

DONALD TRUMP: Then why are we making them? Why do we make them? We had --

(CROSSTALK)

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Because of the old mutual assured destruction, which Reagan hated and tried to get rid of.

DONALD TRUMP: I was against Iraq. I'd be the last one to use the nuclear weapon.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: So can you take it off the table now?

DONALD TRUMP: Because that's sort of like the end of the ball game.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Can you tell the Middle East we're not using a nuclear weapon on anybody?

DONALD TRUMP: I would never say that. I would never take any of my cards off the table.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: How about Europe? We won't use it in Europe?

DONALD TRUMP: I -- I'm not going to take it off the table.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: You might use it in Europe?

DONALD TRUMP: No, I don't think so. But I'm not taking...

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Well, just say it. "I will never use a nuclear weapon in Europe."

DONALD TRUMP: I am not -- I am not taking cards off the table.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: OK.

DONALD TRUMP: I'm not going to use nuclear, but I'm not taking any cards off the table.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: OK.

The trouble is, the sane people hear you and the insane people are not affected by your threats. That's the trouble. The real fanatics say, "Good. Keep it up."

DONALD TRUMP: I think -- I think they're more affected than you might think.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: OK. Your call.

Much more from the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay and our MSNBC exclusive town hall with Donald Trump. Coming back.

(APPLAUSE)

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

We're back from Green Bay, Wisconsin, the home of Green Bay -- University of Wisconsin, Green Bay, with the front-runner for the Republican nomination, Donald Trump. And we have our first question from the people here.

Go ahead.

UNIDENTIFIED: Hi.

DONALD TRUMP: Hi.

UNIDENTIFIED: My name is (INAUDIBLE), and my question for you was regarding your immigration reform.

I was wondering if you could offer a little bit more insight and specific as to what you really hope to change if given the presidency.

DONALD TRUMP: OK. A very good question, and I think it's a very strong question for me, because from the beginning, I have been very strong on immigration, on stopping illegal immigration.

Just so you understand, I want people to come into this country, I want a lot of people to come into the country, but they have to go through a process, they have to do it legally. We have to have a strong southern border, drugs are pouring across the border, tremendous problems -- we're having tremendous problems with crime.

You understand that, everybody understands it. We're going to have very, very strong borders. We're going to have a wall. It's going to happen. Mexico is going to pay for the wall.

And Chris will say, "How are they going to pay? How are they going to pay?" And I'll tell you...

CHRIS MATTHEWS: No, I just don't think they will, but that's all right.

(LAUGHTER)

DONALD TRUMP: OK, they will. You know, when we -- when we lose the --

CHRIS MATTHEWS: How high is this wall going to be lately? How high is it --

DONALD TRUMP: I think a good 35 feet. It's getting higher all the time.

(LAUGHTER)

But -- but --

CHRIS MATTHEWS: I don't think so.

DONALD TRUMP: -- we either have a country and we have borders, or we don't at all. But people will come into the country -- a lot of people are going to come into the country, but they're going to come in legally.

(CROSSTALK)

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Can I ask you about one question and follow up with that, because it only seems to me you can build a pretty high wall, they'll build a tunnel or whatever, they'll take a boat or get a plane ride, they'll get here.

If you had to get here to get a job, you'd get here. And my question is this, what are we going to do about illegal hiring? Because the Republicans joined the Democrats and said -- in that bill a couple of years ago, we're going to stop illegal hiring. If that's the magnet --

DONALD TRUMP: You can do that with eVerify and with...

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Oh, are you for it?

DONALD TRUMP: I'm for it. I use it.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: What should be the punishment for hiring some --

(CROSSTALK)

What should be the punishment for be, really --

DONALD TRUMP: Well --

CHRIS MATTHEWS: You're collaborating with illegal immigrants.

(CROSSTALK)

DONALD TRUMP: Yes, sure, sure. You can be very, very strong, it can be a huge financial penalty, it could be beyond a financial penalty.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Why haven't these guys in your party pass it? Why would they ever pass something like that?

DONALD TRUMP: They don't want to -- well --

CHRIS MATTHEWS: They don't believe in it.

DONALD TRUMP: Well, now -- no, no, some of them do, some of them believe in it very strongly, others don't.

You know, I'm using eVerify on just about every job. At Doral, I'm using it.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Yes.

DONALD TRUMP: But I'm using it on -- they're building the old post office on Pennsylvania Avenue.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Yeah. Good job.

DONALD TRUMP: That I'm building into, what will soon be a phenomenal hotel.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: But isn't -- isn't the --

DONALD TRUMP: And I'm using eVerify, and I'm telling you, it works.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: But in principle, the person who hires someone illegally -- I'm not talking about leaf-raking out in front of the house or helping to push the snow out of the way. I'm talking about somebody who hires them to save money on labor.

You bring in somebody into the country, you give them a free -- you're basically encouraging illegal immigration, because that's why this guy or woman is coming here, right? Isn't that right?

DONALD TRUMP: You can -- yes, and you can solve the problem with eVerify, and other systems...

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Well, why doesn't your party and you back that?

DONALD TRUMP: Well, I back it, and my party backs it.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: No, they don't.

DONALD TRUMP: Many -- well, many people --

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Ryan won't even bring it up on the floor.

DONALD TRUMP: Well, but many people in the party do that.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Ryan's not -- they're not trustworthy. They're not bringing it up. They talk a line about illegal immigration. They want to play these games.

DONALD TRUMP: Like I said, there are many people --

CHRIS MATTHEWS: They like the cheap labor.

DONALD TRUMP: And there are many people --

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Don't they?

DONALD TRUMP: Well, they -- they do in one way, but many people don't, they don't want it.

You know, what, labor -- labor is one thing.

(CROSSTALK)

CHRIS MATTHEWS: The regular working guy doesn't want it, but the business guys, the corporate leaders want the cheap labor.

DONALD TRUMP: Chris, we need borders. We need -- we have a country, we have borders.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: I'm with you.

DONALD TRUMP: People are walking across the border like --

CHRIS MATTHEWS: I like your line, either we have a country or we don't, I'm with you.

DONALD TRUMP: That's it.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: But the way to stop illegal immigration is to stop illegal hiring. It makes economic sense.

DONALD TRUMP: You can do that, you can do that. And I do that on every single job I have.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: OK, let's go to the next question, sir.

UNIDENTIFIED: Good evening, Mr. Trump.

DONALD TRUMP: Hi.

UNIDENTIFIED: I'm Chris Parker.

My question for you is, given recent events with minority protesters at your campaign rallies, can you give me some reasons why a minority voter such as myself would vote for you?

DONALD TRUMP: Because I'm going to bring back jobs to this country and people are going to have jobs. People right now don't have it.

You look at African-American youth, 59 percent unemployment. You go to various places -- you go to Baltimore, you go to all of the -- Oakland, Detroit.

You look that the kind of numbers -- I'm going to bring jobs back. I'm taking them back from China. I'll bring them back from Mexico -- which, by the way, is eating our lunch, both at the border and with economic development, Chris.

I mean, what they're doing --

CHRIS MATTHEWS: I know.

DONALD TRUMP: Ford is going there, Nabisco is going there. Carrier Air Conditioner just announced they're moving to Mexico.

I will bring back jobs and I'm not going to let people go. I will make it so that they're going to want to stay here.

Nobody -- nobody contacts Ford, nobody contacts Nabisco or Carrier. They leave, they leave. That's the end of it. We don't fight to keep these companies here.

We're going to fight. It's going to be jobs. OK? Thank you for your question.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Why do you go to China and you see the cranes on a Friday night, they're working, they're building.

DONALD TRUMP: Yes.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: There cities have seven million people we have never heard of, Hangzhou, Guangxi -- Guangzhou, I forget the pronunciation, but I've been there. They're unbelievable.

When -- how are we going to rebuild our cities? You talk about Penn Station in New York being a dump. LaGuardia being a dumb.

The train -- I took the train a couple of months ago. It takes three days, OK? When are we going to rebuild our country like Europe does, or Japan, or Germany?

DONALD TRUMP: You're right. You're right.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: The countries we beat in World War II all have state of the art stuff, and we're back 70 years.

DONALD TRUMP: Right. And you know why? Because they are killing us with monetary devaluation, with currency devaluation.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: No.

DONALD TRUMP: It's true. It's true.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Our government -- we are not building here.

DONALD TRUMP: But the reason is, our jobs are being taken out, and they're doing it with devaluation.

If you look at what China has done with the devaluation of their currency, they're killing us.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Right. But can you stop it?

DONALD TRUMP: So, it's --

CHRIS MATTHEWS: How much paper do they got?

DONALD TRUMP: You know how you stop it? You stop it by being tough, by saying, you can't do what you're doing.

China is the grand master. They're like a chess master. They --

CHRIS MATTHEWS: All right. Why are they getting away with it? Why are they getting away with it -- they're holding about (INAUDIBLE) trillion dollars of our paper.

DONALD TRUMP: Honestly, because their leaders are smarter than ours.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: And they're paying -- they've got our paper.

DONALD TRUMP: And they have a -- and on top of that, we don't --

CHRIS MATTHEWS: What are they going to do if they dump all of that paper on the world market tomorrow morning?

DONALD TRUMP: You know, we owe them right now $1.7 trillion.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Right. What if they don't --

DONALD TRUMP: But on top of --

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Suppose they dump all those funds?

DONALD TRUMP: We're going to be just fine.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Oh, really? We're going --

DONALD TRUMP: You know what? No, no. We're going to be just fine. Look --

CHRIS MATTHEWS: So, our number one creditor is going to dump us a debtor, and we're going to be just fine.

DONALD TRUMP: Chris, they're making -- we are going to be absolutely just fine, unless we continue with the program we have right now.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Yes.

DONALD TRUMP: Do you know, we have a high dollar. You take a look at what's happening in this country right now.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Right.

DONALD TRUMP: People aren't coming here, our high dollar -- which sounds good to people. Everyone says, oh, that's great. We have a strong dollar. We're getting killed worldwide.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: OK.

DONALD TRUMP: Manufacturing and even -- you look at tourism and everything else coming into this country, it's not happening. We're getting absolutely outmaneuvered by devaluation.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: OK. Yes, I know.

(CROSSTALK)

But you take your approach and your -- seeing all this everywhere, and NATO, make it -- those guys have got to pay their dues, or we're going to get out of there, with 64,000 troops (INAUDIBLE) if we had to.

You say in North -- in North Asia, you say about Japan and South Korea, if they don't start paying more, we're pulling out.

You say in the Middle East, the Saudis and the Jordanians and the Emirates got to start paying, we'll pull out. Or basically -- and then Mexico, if you don't build the wall, blah, blah, blah, we'll cut off your trade.

This bargaining technique of yours is always based on, I don't need this deal, I don't need it.

DONALD TRUMP: Right.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: But these existing deals we have with the Middle East, with Israel.

DONALD TRUMP: You don't need them, you don't need them.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: These existing deals we have with the Middle East --

DONALD TRUMP: You don't need them. Do you think --

CHRIS MATTHEWS: You don't need those deals?

DONALD TRUMP: Do you think we have to protect Saudi Arabia?

CHRIS MATTHEWS: We don't need NATO?

DONALD TRUMP: Do you think -- no, we don't really need NATO in its current form.

NATO is obsolete, and we're spending disproportionately --

CHRIS MATTHEWS: How about the Middle East?

DONALD TRUMP: We are spending so much money -- well, you know what, we're fracking, and with all of the things that are taking place --

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Yes.

DONALD TRUMP: And with all of the oil that Canada has -- Canada has more than almost anybody.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Yes.

DONALD TRUMP: When you look at what we have, we aren't dependent on that anymore, and we very shortly --

CHRIS MATTHEWS: We don't need Jordan, or the Saudis or the Emirates? We don't need those countries?

DONALD TRUMP: Look -- look, people have to pay their fair share.

A year ago, when oil prices were high -- now it's lower, but they're still making a fortune. Saudi Arabia was making $1 billion a day.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: I know.

DONALD TRUMP: And we're defending them and we're getting almost nothing.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: But you act like you're the only one that can cut a deal, that nobody else would be able to cut a deal.

DONALD TRUMP: They don't cut deals like I cut deals, that I can tell you.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: And you're willing walk on all these deals, because that's where you win in our deals? You walk.

DONALD TRUMP: You always have to be able to walk. You have to be able.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: How do you walk from NATO, the Middle East, North Asia, China, all these relationships? Just drop them all?

DONALD TRUMP: Look, NATO is --

CHRIS MATTHEWS: We have old deals we have to stick with.

DONALD TRUMP: -- is 68 years old.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Yes.

DONALD TRUMP: OK, you have countries that are getting a free ride. You have countries that benefit from NATO much more than we do. We don't benefit that much from NATO.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: I just -- I think you can turn down new deals, but all these deals we've had for years like NATO and relationships with Japan. Japan doesn't want a nuclear weapon.

DONALD TRUMP: We defend -- of course, why should they? Well, we give them...

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Do you want them to have a nuclear weapon?

DONALD TRUMP: Wait a minute. We -- before and I'll answer that question. But, we defend -- a lot of people don't even know this. We spend a fortune on defending Japan. We spend a fortune on defending Germany, right?

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Yeah.

DONALD TRUMP: We spend a fortune on defending South Korea. Now, I order thousands of television sets, you know, they come from South Korea.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: I know.

DONALD TRUMP: They make so much. They're making a fortune. They're a behemoth, so is Germany. Why we defend them?

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Because it's in our interest.

DONALD TRUMP: Yeah. But, why aren't they reimbursing us? Why aren't they paying a good portion of the cost?

CHRIS MATTHEWS: It's fine, it's a good argument if you can get it. But, if there are alternatives as we walk.

DONALD TRUMP: I'll get it.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: If the alternative is we walk...

DONALD TRUMP: I'm the messenger. I'll get it.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: OK.

DONALD TRUMP: Another message you...

CHRIS MATTHEWS: No, you're going to do it because they like you or they fear we'll walk?

DONALD TRUMP: No. They're going to get it because it's in their best interest.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: You went -- in Reuters, you said something that...

DONALD TRUMP: If we have to walk, we have to walk.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: ... South Korea and Japan maybe having to develop their own nuclear weapon capability.

DONALD TRUMP: No. What I said is I'll keep it the way it is, but they have to pay their fair share. Just the way you've said, South Korea is a behemoth, they make so much.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: I know.

DONALD TRUMP: The ships of the world, the great ships of the world. You can't buy televisions anymore unless you go to south other than Sony which is in Japan.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Yeah. But, you know, the last time we pulled troops from the 38th parallel we had a problem to the Korean War. So I just want this, you shouldn't be pulling troops.

DONALD TRUMP: I'll tell you what, the Korean War. OK. So we compete with South Korea. I have buildings in South Korea.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Yeah.

DONALD TRUMP: I get along great with the people in South Korea.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: You won't if you pull the troops.

DONALD TRUMP: The top people cannot believe because they didn't know I was going to be running for president. They use to tell me, they don't tell that anymore. They cannot believe they get away with what they get away with.

You know who else? China. I have the largest bank in the world in building paying me lots of rental, largest in the world. I know China. I have the Bank of America building in San Francisco. I got through China, 1,290 of it. I made a lot of money, condos all over the place with China. I know the Chinese better than anybody.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: OK.

DONALD TRUMP: Let me tell you, they can't believe they get away with what they get away with.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: No, they get away with it because we owe them a couple trillion dollars.

DONALD TRUMP: No, they get away because our leaders don't know what they're doing.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: OK. Let's go. I'm monopolizing here. Let's go, young lady.

DONALD TRUMP: Hello.

UNIDENTIFIED: Hello. I am Tai Nini and I have a question on, what is your stance on women rights and their right to choose and their own reproductive health.

DONALD TRUMP: OK. Well, look, I mean, I'm, as you know, I'm pro-life. I think you know that. And I -- with exceptions, with the three exceptions. But pretty much that's my stance. Is that OK? You understand?

CHRIS MATTHEWS: What should the law be on abortion?

DONALD TRUMP: Well, I have been pro-life.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: I know. What should the law -- I know your principle. That's a good value. But, what should be the law?

DONALD TRUMP: They've set the law and frankly the judges -- I mean, you're going to have a very big election coming up for that reason because you have judges where there's a real tipping point and with the loss of Scalia who was, you know, a very strong conservative.

This presidential election is going to be very important because when you say what's the law, nobody knows what the law is going to be. It depends on who gets elected because somebody is going to appoint conservative judges and somebody's going to appoint liberal judges depending on who wins.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: I know. I never understood the pro-life position. I never understood because I understand the principle, its human life when people see it. What crime is it?

DONALD TRUMP: Well, it's human life.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: No, should the woman be punished for having abortion?

DONALD TRUMP: Look...

CHRIS MATTHEWS: And this is not something you can dodge. If you say abortion is a crime or abortion is murder, you have to deal with it under the law. Should abortion be punished?

DONALD TRUMP: Well, people in certain parts of the Republican Party and conservative Republicans would say yes, they should be punished.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: How about you?

DONALD TRUMP: I would say that it's a very serious problem and it's a problem that we have to decide on. It's very...

CHRIS MATTHEWS: But, you're for banning it.

DONALD TRUMP: Well, wait. Are you going to say put them in jail? Is that...

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Well, no. I'm asking you, because you say you want to ban it. What's that mean?

DONALD TRUMP: I would -- I am against. I am pro-life, yes.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: What is then -- how do you ban abortion? How do you actually do it?

DONALD TRUMP: Well, you know, you'll go back to a position like they had where people will, perhaps, go to illegal places.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Yeah.

DONALD TRUMP: But you have to ban it.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: You ban it and they go to somebody who flunked out of medical school.

DONALD TRUMP: Are you catholic?

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Yes. So, I think...

DONALD TRUMP: And how do you feel about the Catholic Church's position?

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Well, I accept the teaching authority of my church on moral issues.

DONALD TRUMP: I know, but do you know their position on abortion?

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Yes, I do.

DONALD TRUMP: And do you concur with that position?

CHRIS MATTHEWS: I concur with their moral position, but legally, to get to the question, here's my problem with it...

DONALD TRUMP: No, no, but let me ask you. But, what do you say about...

CHRIS MATTHEWS: It's not funny.

DONALD TRUMP: ... your church. Yeah, it's you and not the funny thing. What do you say about your church? They are very, very...

CHRIS MATTHEWS: No. But, the churches make their moral judgments, but you running for president of the United States. You will be chief of executive of the United States. Do you believe in punishment for abortion, yes or no, as a principle?

DONALD TRUMP: The answer is that there has to be some form of punishment.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: For the woman?

DONALD TRUMP: Yeah. It has to be some form.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: 10 years, what?

DONALD TRUMP: I don't know. That I don't know.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Why not?

DONALD TRUMP: I don't know.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: You take positions on everything else.

DONALD TRUMP: I frankly -- I do take positions on everything else. It's a very complicated position.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: But you say, one that you're pro-life meaning you want to ban it.

DONALD TRUMP: But, the Catholic Church is pro-life.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Don't talk about my religion.

DONALD TRUMP: No, I am talking about your religion. Your religion -- I mean, you say you're a very good catholic.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: I didn't say very good, I said I'm a catholic. Secondly, I'm asking, you're running for president. I'm not. I'm asking you what should a woman face if she chooses to have an abortion.

DONALD TRUMP: No, no, I'm not going to do that. I'm not going to play that game.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Why not? Game?

DONALD TRUMP: You have...

CHRIS MATTHEWS: You said you're pro-life.

DONALD TRUMP: You have -- I am pro-life.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: That means banning abortion.

DONALD TRUMP: And so is the Catholic Church pro-life.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: But then on control -- this isn't Spain. No control like in the church doesn't control the government.

DONALD TRUMP: What is the punishment under the Catholic Church? What is the punishment?

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Let me give you something for the New Testament. "Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's." Don't ask me about my religion.

DONALD TRUMP: No, no...

CHRIS MATTHEWS: I'm asking you, you want to be president of the United States.

DONALD TRUMP: You told me...

CHRIS MATTHEWS: You tell me what the law should be. Just tell me what the law should be. You say you're pro life.

DONALD TRUMP: I am pro-life.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: What's that mean?

DONALD TRUMP: With exceptions. I am pro-life. I have not determined what the punishment...

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Why not?

DONALD TRUMP: Because I haven't determined it.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Well, when you decided to be pro-life you should have thought of it because....

DONALD TRUMP: No, you can ask anybody...

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Here's the problem and here's my problem with this. If you don't have a punishment for abortion, I don't believe it and of course people are going to find a way to have an abortion.

(CROSSTALK)

DONALD TRUMP: You don't believe in what?

CHRIS MATTHEWS: I don't believe in punishing anybody for having an abortion.

DONALD TRUMP: OK, fine. OK, that's fine.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Of course not and I think it's a women's choice.

DONALD TRUMP: So you're against the teachings of your church?

CHRIS MATTHEWS: I believe -- I have -- as a view and a moral view, but I believe we live in a free country and I don't want to live in a country so fascistic. They can't stop a person for making that decision.

DONALD TRUMP: But, then you...

CHRIS MATTHEWS: That would be so invasive. So determine of a society that I wouldn't be along with familiar with. And Donald Trump, you wouldn't be familiar with.

DONALD TRUMP: But you're speaking so highly about your religion and your church.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Yeah.

DONALD TRUMP: Your church is very, very strongly, as you know, pro-life.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: I know.

DONALD TRUMP: What do you say to your church?

CHRIS MATTHEWS: I say I accept your moral authority. In the United States the people make the decisions, the courts rule on what's in the constitution and we live by that. That's what I say.

DONALD TRUMP: Yeah. But, you don't live by it because you don't accept it. You can't accept it. You can't accept it. You can't accept it.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Can we go back to matters of the law and running for president because matters of the law, what I'm talking about, and this is the difficult situation you placed yourself in, by saying you're pro-life you mean you want to ban abortion.

How do you ban abortion without some kind of sanction? Then you get into the very tricky question of a sanction. A fine on human life, which you call murder.

DONALD TRUMP: It will have to be determined.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: A fine? Imprisonment for a young woman who finds herself pregnant?

DONALD TRUMP: It will have to be determined.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: What about the guy, who gets her pregnant, is he responsible under the law for these abortions or is he not responsible for an abortion decision?

DONALD TRUMP: It has different feelings, different people. I would say no.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Well, they're usually involved. Anyway, much more from the audience here at the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay. We'll be right back.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

Welcome back to Green Bay, Wisconsin, for our exclusive Town Hall with Donald Trump. We're here at the University of Wisconsin Green Bay. More now from our audience. Congratulations, grandpa.

DONALD TRUMP: Thank you.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Theodore, right?

DONALD TRUMP: Theodore James.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Speaking of being pro-life.

DONALD TRUMP: Right.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Go ahead, first question.

DANA SHROME: Mr. Trump, I'm Dana Shrome. And my question for is, could you provide us a little bit of your position on the right to marry for gays and lesbians as well as if you'll continue the fight for equality for those individuals?

DONALD TRUMP: Well, the courts have decided so that's really not a subject that's come up. But the courts have decided. I would have preferred states making the decision, but the courts have decided.

DANA SHROME: Just a quick furthermore, could you maybe talk about how you might increase equality for people of the transgender community?

DONALD TRUMP: I would say that I'm going to go by the laws of the courts and the courts said really is very much up in flux right now, but I'll go by the laws.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Next question. Go ahead.

DONALD TRUMP: Hi.

CHRIS COLTER: Hi, Mr. Trump. My name is Chris Colter. I'm wondering what your plan is for addressing rising college tuition costs and student loan debt. Would you support something as aggressive as, say, student loan forgiveness?

DONALD TRUMP: I get this question more than any other question when I'm with young college students and they are absolutely up to their neck in debt and they can't get jobs when they graduate even if they're good students in many cases and they don't know what to do. They're really stuck.

And we're going to work on a plan where it's going to be extensions, where it's going to be very low interest. We're going to work on it because something has to be done.

Chris, I get that question more than any other question is what are we going to do about student debt? It's an enormous problem in this country. And the biggest part of the problem is they graduate from college, good colleges and they can't get jobs, so we're going to work on it.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Yeah.

DONALD TRUMP: Yes?

ELENA COLT: My name is Elena Colt. And I'm a retired veteran.

DONALD TRUMP: Good.

ELENA COLT: And I'm just wondering who your top military advisers are and who your top veterans affairs adviser is.

DONALD TRUMP: Well, I really announced and I'm going to be announcing some at the end of this week. I've announced the whole list. I gave it out last week. And we have Walid Phares and some tremendous people.

And frankly as far as the vets are concerned, I thought when you started saying vet, I thought you were going to ask me another question because the vets in this country are being treated horribly.

ELENA COLT: I agree.

DONALD TRUMP: When you talk about illegal immigration, you're talking about they're being treated worse in many cases than illegal immigrants. And we haven't straight that out. We're going to straight it out fast. What's going on, it's corrupt, the veteran's administration and it's incompetently run. So I can tell you as a vet, you're going to be very, very happy with Trump.

ELENA COLT: Thank you very much.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: We're going to keep up the questionings here at the Town Hall with Donald Trump after this.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

We're back to Green Bay, Wisconsin, with Donald Trump. Let's ask more questions. The Mayor of the city, Jim Schmitt, your honored.

JIM SCHMITT: Mr. Trump, welcome to Green Bay, and Chris.

DONALD TRUMP: Thank you.

JIM SCHMITT: Say, as a fellow politician where some of us are embarrassed about the decorum of this campaign and just the attitudes and the flavor that this has taken and I'm wondering what you can do as the front-runner of the Republican Party to really elevate the issues and get away from some of these pettiness we've been experiencing.

DONALD TRUMP: Well, first of all, congratulations, 14 years as mayor of Green Bay. That's a great honor. But, I will tell you, I think that generally speaking I agree. We have some very hard issues. We talk about them.

I would much rather talk about the issues than the kind of things that are brought up. The things get brought up and sometimes they get brought up because it's me, and sometimes they get brought up for a lot of other reasons. But, I think it's very important that we elevate the conversation and I agree with you 100 percent.

I would much rather be discussing nuclear and all of the other issues that we're discussing than the kind of things that you're referring to. Thank you, Mr. Mayor.

SHANA FRELICK: Hello.

DONALD TRUMP: How are you?

SHANA FRELICK: Good. My name is Shana Frelick. I'm a professor here at the communication department.

DONALD TRUMP: Good.

SHANA FRELICK: So my question for you is around prison reform. What do you see needs to be reformed with our prison system and with that, what do you think about drug legalization playing into the reform?

DONALD TRUMP: I think that as far as drug legalization, we talk about marijuana and in terms of medical. I think I am basically for that. I've heard some wonderful things in terms of medical.

I'm watching Colorado very carefully. See what's happening out there. I'm getting some very negative reports. I'm getting some OK reports. But, I'm getting some very negative reports coming out of Colorado as to what's happening, so we'll see what happens. And I think a lot of people are really looking at Colorado.

For prison reform, I think, as you know, our prison system is a disaster. It's a complete disaster. All over the country, almost everything we have, Chris, if you want to know the truth is a disaster.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Really? America is not great. It's not bad.

DONALD TRUMP: If you take a look -- look, our military has been depleted. Our vets are not being taking care of. I mean, we have a lot of problems. OK.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Why does everybody want to come here if we're not great? Everybody in the world wants to come here and everybody does better in this country than where they came from, everybody.

DONALD TRUMP: Other people have problems, too. Anyway with prison, I do think we can to a lot of privatizations and private prisons. It seems to work a lot better.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: What are the problems you've heard about Colorado because a lot of people wonder about who do you want smoking dope? I mean, do you want -- you're train conductor, the bus driver, the airplane pilot, no.

What do you -- maybe the guy who teaches philosophy, it might be OK? I mean, does anybody trust anybody who's high to do anything? I'm serious about this. It's not recreational drugs. What's that mean?

DONALD TRUMP: There's a lasting negative impact. I mean, you do

CHRIS MATTHEWS: The loss of ambition.

DONALD TRUMP: Yeah.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: No, I think is there.

DONALD TRUMP: There's a loss of something. So that book has not been written yet, but it's going to be written pretty soon. And I'm not hearing very positive things.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Yeah, nice.

MICHAEL RECTOR: Hi.

DONALD TRUMP: Yes, hi.

MICHAEL RECTOR: My name is Michael Rector. My question is, so you're on the record saying that there might be riots in the event that you're not the Republican Party nominee.

DONALD TRUMP: No. By the way, I hope not.

MICHAEL RECTOR: No, I hope not, too. I mean, asking about that, in fact...

DONALD TRUMP: They won't be led by me, but will be a lot of unhappy people.

MICHAEL RECTOR: So, yeah. So, in the event that a brokered convention doesn't award the nomination to you, does your campaign have any programs or plans to mitigate violence among your supporters?

DONALD TRUMP: We'll, we'll have definitely the largest number of votes no matter what happens. We'll have definitely the largest number of votes and we'll also have definitely the number of delegates by far, nobody is even going to be close.

Will we get to 1,237? I think so. I do believe we will and I hope we will because it will be very nice. I'll do a very good job. But, I think we will.

If we don't, I can't really tell you what happens. Look, people are being disenfranchised in this country. They looked at me as somebody and they look at me as somebody that's going to bring them back.

We haven't had -- you haven't had a real salary increase, if you're a blue-collar worker, in over 12 years. They're getting -- it's getting worse and worse and worse. These are smart people. These are people that have always had good jobs. Their jobs have been taken away. They've been sent over to China, Mexico, and many other countries and they're not doing as well as they were doing 12 and 15 years ago.

I will bring that back. And they know I will bring that back. And I'm the only one that's going to bring it back. I'm the only one that understands the subject, and frankly, I'm the only one that really even talks about the subject and I think you're going to have some people that are going to be very, very upset if I'm leading.

Now, if I'm not leading, somebody else has more votes, somebody else has more delegates, that's a different thing. But, if I'm leading by a lot and let say I'm a little bit short of that number, and I told you before, that number is a little bit fictitious because I'm not running against one or two people. Right now I am, but for the last six months we've been running against many, many people.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Yeah.

DONALD TRUMP: So it's really a very unfair standard. But, if I'm a little bit short, but I'm millions of votes and hundreds of delegates ahead of other people, I think you're going to have some very unhappy people. I hope nothing bad happens, but I think you're going to have some very, very angry and unhappy people.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: What will you be?

DONALD TRUMP: I think...

CHRIS MATTHEWS: What will you say to the American people who voted for you in that moment?

DONALD TRUMP: I can't say yet because that's a very emotional situation you're talking about.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Yeah.

DONALD TRUMP: So, I can't really tell you what I will do or what I'll say. I can say this. If I'm way ahead in all -- by all counts, if I'm way ahead, I would be very disappointed. You know, we're supposed to be a democracy.

The Louisiana thing is a terrible thing. I told you before. I won and I end up with less delegates...

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Who do you trust in the Republican leadership? Suppose you come in around 1,150 and you think that's a give me, they say it's not a give me. It's too far from the cut. OK, fine.

So, who do you go to? You go to Kasich and say, "Look, John, I need a V.P. I need your delegates. Would you think if doing that they will get you over the top?

DONALD TRUMP: I don't want to reveal what I may do. I mean, I may do...

CHRIS MATTHEWS: But you said you...

DONALD TRUMP: I may.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: You said you may use nuclear weapons, but you can't tell me how you're going to operate the convention?

DONALD TRUMP: No, I didn't say that. I never rule -- you don't want to from a negotiating standpoint...

CHRIS MATTHEWS: OK.

(CROSSTALK)

Do you trust anybody? Do you trust Reince Priebus to play it fair?

DONALD TRUMP: Do I trust anybody? Let's put it that way.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Do you trust Mitt Romney not trying to go in there and grab it back?

DONALD TRUMP: No. I don't trust Mitt Romney. Mitt Romney was disgraced. He should have won that election.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: But, he's trying to get it out here.

DONALD TRUMP: Well, he's not going to get it. He should have won that election. Mitt Romney let us down. That was an election that should have been won, he failed.

You know, what he did? He choked. He went away. He choked. Just like a dog. He choked. It was a very...

CHRIS MATTHEWS: You're good at this. But, I'm asking you...

DONALD TRUMP: No, no, I'm not good at it. I'm just telling you the facts.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Were you the guy who gave nicknames in high school?

DONALD TRUMP: No, but I give some nicknames, right now when I'm...

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Big ears, I mean, little hands, I 'm sorry. That was you, I'm sorry. We'll be right back with more of Donald Trump in just a minute.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

We're back with Donald Trump for just a couple more minutes.

So, I want to give you a chance here because a couple things in this campaign you said have grabbed me and I thought were powerful. And I want you to take a minute. I'll give you a break here just to do it. Either we have a country or we don't.

DONALD TRUMP: Right.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: What did you mean by that?

DONALD TRUMP: I mean, we have to have borders. We have to have borders. We can't let people just walk in and out of our country like we do right now.

We don't have borders. People are pouring into the country. The border patrol just today endorsed me and that's a big endorsement.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: What do they think of this wall idea?

DONALD TRUMP: They like the wall and they like to be given their strength back. They want to be able to do their job. These are great people. These are people that can do their job, but they're not allowed to do it.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: You're asking the Mexican government to put a wall up to keep its own people in.

DONALD TRUMP: No, no, no, no. We are putting the wall up.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: They're going to pay for it. So they're going to pay for our wall to keep their people in their country. This can be like the Berlin wall. It's the only time to build a wall to keep your own people in. Why would any country pay to keep its on people in?

DONALD TRUMP: Let me tell you something.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: It's never happened...

DONALD TRUMP: We have right now...

CHRIS MATTHEWS: ... except the Berlin wall.

DONALD TRUMP: We have a trade deficit with Mexico, $58 billion a year. The wall is going to cost approximately $10 billion. Believe me they will pay in one form or another.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: If not, or else what?

DONALD TRUMP: You know what, they could stop a lot of the problem. You know, if you want to become a citizen of Mexico, you want to get into Mexico...

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Yeah.

DONALD TRUMP: It is impossible.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: I know. I'm not saying they're not hypocritical.

DONALD TRUMP: Let me just tell you...

CHRIS MATTHEWS: I know that.

DONALD TRUMP: ... they could stop a lot of the problems that we're having by themselves. They don't choose to do it. Not right. And we have a trade deficit, $58 billion...

CHRIS MATTHEWS: So we cut off...

DONALD TRUMP: ... they'll pay for the wall.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: This is your strategy in every case. We can walk. No more trade.

DONALD TRUMP: You have...

CHRIS MATTHEWS: No more trade with Mexico.

DONALD TRUMP: Oh, absolutely.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: No more troops in Europe.

DONALD TRUMP: And by the way, when I say no more trade, once you -- once they know that you are really willing to go that extra length, there will always be trade, but we'll make good deals. We're making...

CHRIS MATTHEWS: The bottom line is always we walk.

DONALD TRUMP: You have to be able to walk. Yes. It's unlikely that you'll have to, but you have to be able to...

CHRIS MATTHEWS: These or else's could be very tricky. Anyway, thank you, Mr. Trump.

DONALD TRUMP: Thank you very much.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: This argument will continue. Thank you, Donald Trump. And thank you to the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay.

And coming up next the big night of politics continues on MSNBC with Rachel Maddow and both Democratic candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders tonight on Green Bay.

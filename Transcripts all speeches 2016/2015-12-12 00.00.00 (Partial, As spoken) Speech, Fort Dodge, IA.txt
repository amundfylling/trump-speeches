DONALD TRUMP: Carson is an enigma. He wrote a book and in the book he said terrible things about himself. He said that he's pathological and that he's got basically pathological disease.

If you're a child molester, there's no cure. They can't stop you. Pathological, there's no cure. He said he went after his mother with a hammer. He wanted to hit her on the head, or he hit her on the head or he wanted to hit her on the head. And I said, wow, that's tough. So he went after his mother. This is in his book. This isn't me. I'm just trying to save you the cost of a book. So he's a pathological, damaged, temper, a problem.

(BREAK)

He took a knife and he went after a friend and he lunged, he lunged that knife into the stomach of his friends. But lo and behold, it hit the belt. It hit the belt. And the knife broke. Give me a break. Give me a break. Give me a break. The knife broke.

Let me tell you, I'm pretty good at this stuff. I have a belt. Somebody has to hit me with the belt going in because the belt moves this. It moves this way. It moves that way. He hit the belt buckle. Anybody have a knife, want to try it on me?

(LAUGHTER)

Believe me, it ain't going to work. You're going to be successful. But he took the knife, he went like this and he plunged it into the belt. And amazingly the belt stayed totally flat and the knife broke.

No, no, no, no. It happened. How dare the press not believe me that I went after my mother with a hammer, that I hit somebody in the face with a padlock. That I tried to stab a friend of mine whose name was BOB but now it's changed. Whose name was BOB, he was a friend but now he's a member of my family. Oh, the knife broke. There it is. So what he's saying is that these series of events and he goes into the bathroom for a couple of hours and now he's religious. And the people of Iowa believe him. Give me a break. Give me a break. It doesn't happen that way."

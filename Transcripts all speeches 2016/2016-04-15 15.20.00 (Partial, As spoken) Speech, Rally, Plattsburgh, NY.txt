DONALD TRUMP: What's happening, we're going to stop it, folks. We're going to bring back jobs to New York state. We're going to bring them back fast, very, very fast.

(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

You know what I have been doing when I'm going around the state?

And we have had big -- we were in Albany, in Rochester, in Rome, our Rome, as opposed to the other Rome, right? But -- and you look at the numbers. And what I have been doing, I have been asking people, give me some numbers. Let me see how we're doing. How are we doing up in Plattsburgh?

So here's some numbers. United States industrial production, right, declined for the past seven straight months. Our GDP is like zero. If in China their GDP dips below 7, 8, 9 percent, you know what they do? It's like a major catastrophe. Ours is zero. We're down to practically nothing.

Here's a strong-looking guy right there. Yes. That's OK. That's my kind of a guy. He's got the flag. He's got the whole deal. Good job. Good job. Only in America, folks, only in America. Thank you.

AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA!

DONALD TRUMP: Thank you. That's true.

The number of people with a job in Plattsburgh has been -- has really -- over the last 15 years, it's really gone down. There are nearly 3,000 fewer people right now working in your community than they had in 2000. Not good. Come on, folks, what's wrong here? What's wrong?

You know what's wrong. You need leadership. That's what's wrong, because you got the right people. We have got the best people. The unemployment rate in Plattsburgh right now is higher today substantially than it was just six months ago. So who left?

DONALD TRUMP: Hello, everybody. Thank you. Please sit down, sit down. It's great to be back in New York, I will say that. Great to be back. What a crowd. You know, I thought I would do something a little different. When I heard a few months ago, and he said we would love for you to speak. And I said, where are you going to have it? He said at the Grand Hyatt. And he said, I love to speak at the Grand Hyatt because I built this hotel.

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

And it was a very, very successful deal. I built it, it was toward the end of the '70s and the market was horrible and this area, for those of you like my very good friends, and everybody, I mean, would say that this was a crazy deal and I shouldn't have done it. And I said, I have to do it. And my father, who was in Brooklyn, in Queens, he said, son, we don't know anything about Manhattan. Don't do it. Don't do it. You're making a mistake. I said pop, I want to do it. I want to be in Manhattan. I agree the location is terrible, you got to see the people. That was really, you know, it was -- that is when I have to say, Republicans for Gerald Ford said to New York, drop dead, right?

Drop dead. That was a killer. That was not a good time for our city, right? That was a bad time for our city. But it was something that was -- we had to do something because we love New York, we love New York. And that was probably maybe the worst of the worst. But I just wanted to do it. I love the building, I love the potential of the building. It's called the Commodore Hotel. It was built in 1909 and it was a mess. And they had a spa and the spa was called relaxation plus. And nobody ever got into what the plus meant. You don't want to know.

(LAUGHTER)

And everybody in the building was failing. Every retail tenant in the building was failing. And I was able to get most of that. But relaxation plus was making an absolute fortune and I couldn't get them out. And I asked about all sorts of things. I shouldn't say this too loud because I will be really ridiculed by the conservatives, of which I am one. I even said, what about condemnation? But I didn't do that. OK? So everybody happy I didn't do that. But I ended up getting them out, and brought the building down to its steel, except for some of the details on a couple of the ceiling, because they would have been very hard. This is one of the rooms actually, right here, the detail of the ballroom, and the details of the rooms outside and trying to save those details cost a fortune.

Because when the whole building was brought down to the steel, we had to put canvas over all of the areas we were saving and when it rained that was not an easy situation. But I got it built, and what happened is as we were opening the market changed. Because the city was doing so badly. And that was the worst that the city had ever been economically also. And people leaving, companies were leaving in droves and it was just something of a miracle. The area, I opened the building to tremendous fanfare and the area became just special, I mean, special. And I called it a Park Avenue address, even though it fronted on 42nd street. I called it Park Avenue. You know, it's on the Park Avenue ramp, in all fairness, right?

I had a choice of Lexington Avenue, 42nd street or Park Avenue. And guess what? I chose Park Avenue. And that wasn't bad, right?

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

So I had also been in Columbus Circle. You know, I did the big hotel. Trump International and it's been a great success from the day it was built and we're in the circle. And Columbus Circle didn't have a good name, but it also was on Central Park West but it was called 7 Columbus Circle. And a little known fact and fact, you know, when we talk about government, we talk about rules and regulations. A little known fact is that when you have an address, at least in New York, when you have an address on a building, it's very, very hard. So hard to change.

So when you have a building that's 7 Columbus Circle, you have to go through the whole United States government to get because of themail service and because of the U.S. mail and all of the different problems. So it was 7 Columbus, and I basically stripped that one down. We built a tremendous building but I had to call it 7 Columbus Circle. I said, I am not doing it. And I went out and I really put on a big campaign in Washington and I got it changed to number 1 Central Park West. That was good, too.

(APPLAUSE)

And you know, I figured the day I got that changed, the building was worth about seven times more than I paid for it. Right? So, anyway. But this has been just an amazing event, this building. And I think of it because when I did the building, everybody said, don't do it. It can't be done. It's never going to happen. Bad area. Bad location. Tremendous crime. The city is dying. It wasn't just like not doing well, the city was dead.

And I remember when I said to a friend of mine who was in a different business, a very good business, and he was talking about what I did, became a friend. And I said, well, I'm in the real estate business in New York. He looked at me and said oh, that's too bad. That's how bad it was. But it turned out to be a great business, number one. And it turned out to be a great, great success as a hotel. And it was built and Hyatt was my partner, and we did a good job and it was from the time it opened, it was amazing, because from the day it opened the market changed.

And that's happened with a number of jobs. That happened with me with 40 Wall Street. I bought a building. The tallest building in downtown Manhattan. I bought it during the depression, literally the depression, of the early '90s and paid very little for it. Again, nobody wanted it. And then when I opened, it was like the world had changed and it became a tremendously successful building, which I still have. So a lot of things happened. But with this one in particular, because when I did it, people just didn't want it, especially my father. My father was the man that taught me the most.

And he loaned me a small amount of money and I built it into a great, great company. And it was, you know, just something I love. But he was so against me coming into Manhattan. And then this became so successful and he said wow, paid him back the money. Did other things. We did the Convention Center, the Jacob Javits Convention Center. I got the state and the city to build and to this day -- they were going to build that in the water and they had all sorts of environmental approvals. And even then, they had environmental approvals. And they had the Pierhead Bulkhead (PH) problems. They had tremendous problems.

And they were in the wrong location. I went to Governor Kerry, who was a democrat, but I want to tell you, he was a great, great problem solver. And they were spending so much money and wasting it. They couldn't get any approval. And I went to the Governor. We had a man, I won't mention his name, but he's very well known. And he was totally against what I was doing. And he just wanted to build it in this one location which was a bad, you had to go through hell's kitchen, and you have to go under the Westside Highway, you have to build ramps over the highway, you had no access. And on top of that, it was being built in the Hudson River and you couldn't get any approval. So, other than that, it was a wonderful site.

And this guy, I won't mention his name, his name was Richard Ravitch (PH), was totally, New Yorkers know that. He was so intent on building it and I was arguing with him and fighting. And I said look, I have an option to the Westside railroad yards. And I had it for this purpose. I did it with the Penn Central Company which was in bankruptcy. And I said look, this, you don't have to go, it's on the proper side of the Westside highway. The site is big. The site is great. We went up to Governor Kerrey PH and Governor Kerrey appointed Ravitch to head up this commission, to build the convention center. And they were just about starting.

And I sat down, I'll never forget it. I sat down with the Governor Kerrey and his staff and he said, you make the case for your site. And he made a case for 20 minutes. And every time he talked it was just wrong, wrong, wrong. He said Donald, will you make the case? I made the case, it took me five minutes. At the end of five minutes, he says not even close, totally changed gears, we got the approvals quickly, we got it build. It was called the Jacob Javitz Convention Center, until this day -- so we're happy about it.

(APPLAUSE)

And then I built, you know, many other buildings all over the city. I mean, I'm just listing some of them, because this one really was my first. This was my first. This was my first. The Grand Hyatt Hotel. And then little things like The Wollman Rink, seven years the city couldn't fix an ice skating rink. Probably --

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

I think I became more famous because of the Wollman Rink. They had -- for seven years they couldn't build an ice skating rink, for seven years. And I had my daughter, Ivanka. She was very -- did anybody here know Ivanka? Anybody? But she was a very young girl. She kept saying daddy, daddy, can we go ice skating? And year after year I said you can't because they're building the rink. And finally, I went down, I looked and I saw 400 men, in those case it was all men, today it was men and women at the construction. People which is great. But it was all men. Four hundred men sitting in the rink, not working. And I came back a half hour later, they still weren't working, they were taking lunch breaks many, many times a day. Nobody was working.

And they went out and they got from Miami Beach an expert on ice. But they meant refrigerators, not to make ice. And I never forget -- sort of an interesting story, I hope it's interesting. But I got to tell it anyway because who the hell wants to talk about politics all the time? Right? Because politics gets a little boring. But what happened I went to the mayor and said, listen, Mr. Mayor Ed Koch, I said it's seven years now, it's going to be eight, nine, ten. They have no idea. They used a thing called Freon. And that's a gas that goes through copper pipping, copper tubing. They had six miles of copper, they had four inches apart. And it was laid this massive rink. It's almost 90,000 square feet.

That's like big, big office floors times three. Big spots, still there, you see it. I've run it. I've run it for many, many years. It's been such a tremendous place. But they had the Freon and it was laid four inches, miles of it. And every time they put this beautiful copper down, every single time, the next night people would steal it. So they kept putting it down, kept getting stole. Putting it down, kept getting stole. Then they put the police force around and it was fine, until the police forces decide to go to lunch and it was all stolen. So, they were losing millions of dollars. They were actually in for $22 and they had nothing.

And I went to see Ed Koch. And he said, I'm not going to let you do it. And then I went to see some of the newspapers. I went to the editorial boards. I said, the mayor can't let us do. I can fix this thing and do it in six months to a year and you're going to be years and years and they don't know what they're doing and they're spending a fortune. And I'll never forget, I went to two editorial boards, the New York Times and the other one, I won't say because I don't like the paper. But I do like "The New York Post." I do like "The New York Post."

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

And they did editorials, you have to let him do it. You have to let him do it. Anyway, they let me do it. I took over the project and a lot of people said, well, it was built. It wasn't built. The concrete was poured. It was nine inches higher on one side than the other side. So when you poured the water, you had a big swimming pool here and this one -- it was just a mess. And the one was so deep you couldn't freeze it because it was too much. So I had to rip out the entire slab and the slab was a foot and a half thick. It only had to be four inches. And so we ripped it and we did. And I finished it in four months and I said, if it cost anymore more than $2 million -- it's true. Because it's a great govern.

You know, they study this at the Wharton School, they study it at Harvard, because the difference maybe between the public sector and the private sector. I went in, big, you know, it's really been -- to this day it's a great case study. I went in and we did a job like you wouldn't believe. We took out that horrible big massive slab of concrete. We leveled it out. But most importantly, I said to the people what is with this Freon. I hear they're losing millions of dollars of copper tubing all the time. What is it? And I said, who are the people? And they said, well, it's an air conditioning firm from Miami. I said, from Miami?

I don't want ice from Miami. So I called up a friend of mine who was a partner of the Montreal Canadian. It's not we're talking, right? Ice. I said, would you do me a favor? Do you have anybody that knows how to make ice for an ice skating rink? He said, I have the greatest guy in the world. I said, could I talk to him, please? And he came to New York and he saw me. He said this is crazy. He said Mr. Trump, they're going to have five miles of this piping. If there's a little pinhole because it's gas, free on gas, it there's a little pinhole, in five miles, it's dead. He said you don't want that. You want rubber hose and you want water and in the water you put salt so it doesn't freeze.

I said boy, that sounds good. And I went out and we bought it for just a tiny amount of money and it was rubber hose every four inches. But it's rubber hose. We got the equipment, it's called brine, they call it brine. And we did the rubber hose. Nobody stole the rubber hose.

(LAUGHTER)

Nobody wanted it. We didn't need security. Nobody stole the rubber hose. And we opened it up and it was the most amazing thing. We put the rubber hose down, we tested it, there wasn't a leak in the whole thing. 6.2 miles of rubber hose. Can you believe it? That's a lot. There wasn't a leak. Now what happened is we put the concrete over. We had concrete trucks lined up to Harlem. Now, all of my construction friends in that corner, in fact, they all have the worst seats, I don't know why.

Construction guys usually have the best seats. But they understand what I'm talking about. Because we wanted a continuous pour. Because the city used to pour ten feet, come back a week later and pour another ten feet. And yet, all these blocks got -- we had all the way back to Harlem, we had trucks and the most amazing thing. And they poured. It took two days to pour the slab. We actually made it six inches because that's better. And we turned on and we put two inches of water on top of the slab. And they made lasers. It was such a perfect slab, to this day it's perfect. They then put the water on top. I said try it.

Because this thing hadn't had ice in nine years. I said try it. And in two hours we had the most beautiful ice, just like the Montreal Canadians.

(APPLAUSE)

And we had our rink. And we had our rink. So I've had a lot of fun with New York and we did another job recently in the Bronx where it was the same thing. Where they had, you know, Ferry Point.

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

There they are. You know what I'm talking about. Ferry Point was under construction for 26 years. I mean, people say, give me a break. The only reason I don't say 32 is because I can't be proven. Twenty six years. It ended up costing hundreds of millions of dollars, nobody knows what the price is. And Michael Bloomberg said, could you do me a favor? Could you look at this? It's a disaster. It's been under construction for so many years and he was embarrassed. And it's a very big golf project, it was designed by Jack Nicklaus. And, you know, many, many iterations, but I got to built in one year and it's open today and greatly successful.

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

So, and by the way, and for peanuts. When I say open, am I right? That woman right there. She's probably -- am I right?

UNIDENTIFIED: You're right!

DONALD TRUMP: Thank you, darling. I appreciate it. Very nice. I don't know who the hell she is. I know she's not a protester, she's on my side.

(APPLAUSE)

And she's certainly not a pay -- I'll tell you what, you take a look outside, these are paid protesters, folks. They have got the most beautiful signs made from a factory. They were printed out. They hand it. It said, if you want the information on the sign, please call this number. If they're real protesters, we want those signs made in the basement.

(APPLAUSE)

Anyway, so then we've done many jobs since then and it's such a great city. It's a vibrant city and amazing city. We have to be careful. Our mayor has to be careful, because he can blow it very quickly if he keeps going the way he's going. Not doing good. We better be careful, Mr. Mayor. But we have a city that outlasts the mayors, it outlasts everybody. It's going to outlast us. It's one of the great, great cities of the world and it's called New York City.

(APPLAUSE)

All right? And I think while I'm at it, and we're so proud of so many of the jobs, especially my job on the Westside of Manhattan, which is almost 6,000 units, goes from 72nd Street to 59th Street, a tremendous success. And just so many great, great experiences from New York. And we can do the same thing with our country. We can bring these jobs in, under budget, instead of 20 times budget. We need infrastructure. We need more military. Our military is being decimated. We have to take care of or vets. We have to do so many things, but we can do it, same thing, large scale version. Ice skating rinks and Ferry Point. You know, it's all the same thing.

We're doing the hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue. The GSA, total professionals by the way, who I think the most competitively bid job in the history of the GSA, everybody wanted it. The old post office. And we got it, Ivanka was working on it. The concept was great and our financial statement is great, because I wanted to make sure it got built. It's now under budget ahead of schedule. It is going to open in September. More than a year substantially more than a year ahead of schedule. And we'll have it open in September of this year as opposed to almost two years from then. And it's going to be great.

It will be open -- it will be open for our fantastic parade. You all can join me. You guys can stay in the hotel, I'll be in the White House and you'll stay in the hotel, OK?

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

One of the reporters recently asked me, they said, Mr. Trump, let me ask you, if you win the presidency, sir, will you be staying in your beautiful new hotel or the White House? I said, I'll take the White House. I want to talk just for a second about New York values. Because it's become a big thing.

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

And I wrote a few things down, but it's just one of those things. You know, I talked tonight about New York values that we all, many of us, that we all know so well. The values that make us love this state, which has been a symbol of American strength throughout the world, no matter where you go. They love New York. You know, you can be from lots of other places, and if you want to see somebody, you just say when are you coming to New York? Everybody comes to New York eventually. There's nothing like it. So when we talk about values, what do we see in New York values? We see our really, really, incredible, when you look at September 11, especially, New York police and New York firefighters, incredible.

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

We see our unbelievable, and they keep those trains going, and those buses and everything else, but we see our transit workers and what they went through on September 11 was incredible. We see families playing in Central Park. Thousands and thousands of families with their children. Some without children. Some together. Some not together. But we see people in Central Park and people playing in Central Park. We see restaurant workers all over the city in delis and factory workers in Upstate New York. Unfortunately, I spent a lot of time in Upstate New York and those factory workers are rapidly, rapidly leaving our state.

And we can't let that happen. And we have a whole fabric of our community. So what are New York values? Because you know, people are disputing. I'm not disputing. And the New Yorkers aren't disputing, and most people that no New York have watched what we've done, when you look at what happened with September 11th, the job that this city has done and the people that this city have done is beyond what anyone has ever seen. And you say, what are New York values? Number one, honesty and straight talking. Honestly, you better believe it.

(APPLAUSE)

It's a work ethic. Hardworking people. It's about family. New York, believe it, is about family. So important. It's the energy to get things done. Big energy. If Jeb Bush came here, I'm telling you, he would have much more energy than he has right now.

(LAUGHTER)

I'm telling you. He should move to New York, right? We're builders. We make things happen. It's so important. We make things happen. And it's courage and community service, because there's tremendous community service. New York values were on display for all to see in the aftermath of 9/11. A strike at the heart of our city and our nation. In our darkest moments, as the city, we showed the world the very, very best in terms of bravery and heart and soul that we have in America.

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

The firefighters and first responders and the police officers and the Port Authority workers who ran up those stairs, those are New York values and those are New Yorker values. I'm not sure, is she serious or what? For the Michael Judge Chaplain to the New York City Fire Department who, you know, died, and an amazing guy who I knew, a little bit -- who a lot of people knew very well, who Rudy Giuliani really knew very well, but you look at father, judge, and I tell you what, that was some guy and he will end up there to pray and he knew what was going to happen and he died. And he died praying and taking care of people and he was an amazing guy. The people in the towers, who helped rescue each other, those are those of New York values.

The restaurants and local businesses who kept their shops open to help everybody during this incredible time, those are New York values. Everyone who helped clear the rubble and the rescue, the injured, those are New York values. Every small act of kindness. Every great act of courage of which there was so many. There's never been anything like this. This was the greatest attack and the worst and most horrific attack in the history of our country. Far greater than Pearl Harbor, because the attack was on civilians. It wasn't on the military. It was on civilians. But those are New York values. And these are the values that we need to make America great again. We need these values.

To bring America together again, and to heal America's wounds again. So, I just want to tell you that I am so proud to be with you tonight. I am so proud to be discussing all sorts of topics, but most importantly, New York values. Because no matter where you go, anywhere in the world, they talk in the most positive tones about what all of us have done. So ladies and gentlemen, have a great dinner. We're going to have an amazing election coming up. We're having some really great primaries. It's been a lot of fun for me. You know, it wasn't supposed to be this way. A lot of people said, well, what do you know? I've been dealing with politicians all my life, so I think I know something. But it's been a great, great experience.

Right now, I'm millions of votes ahead of my closest rival. Millions of votes. You know, people don't talk about votes anymore.

(APPLAUSE)

They talk delegates. By the way, I happen to be hundreds of delegates ahead, too. But, you now, to me, so important, I'm millions of votes ahead of my next nearest rival. And we have, thank you, thank you, darling. Millions of votes. We have states, 42 states, and it started, by the way, with New Hampshire. We went down to South Carolina. States that I wasn't supposed to win and I ended up winning in a landslide. Alabama, Arkansas, Kentucky, the South. I may move to South if New York doesn't treat us well. Because I'll tell you, the south has been so great to me. And then we went to Florida, where, you know, that's my second home.

This is my first home. That's my second home. And we did so unbelievably well. Won in a landslide by 20 points and it was an absolute landslide. And now we have something happening that's going to be very exciting. The next four or five weeks are going to be very exciting. And we start -- we'll bring it home. Thank you, thank you, man. And we start on Tuesday. So big. And, you know, the interesting thing is, with all the primaries that we've been through, years and years and years of primaries, some of these are not very important by the time we get to New York. Right? New York is so important, it's so important. Like New York should be so important. And I see what's happening and I see the polls coming in and I'm so honored, because the people that know me best are the people from New York.

They're the ones that really know me. So when I'm up 42 points, I said, 42 points? That's a lot. But when I'm up 42 and 44 points in the newest polls, that's such an honor, because those are the people that know me best. So, I think we're going to have a really exciting next four or five weeks. I think we'll going to have a great time in Cleveland. Hopefully not too good a time because by that time, it should be solved, by the time we get there. OK? And enjoy the hotel. Enjoy this great, great city. And it's an honor to be with you tonight. Thank you very much, everybody.

(APPLAUSE)

Thank you. Thank you.

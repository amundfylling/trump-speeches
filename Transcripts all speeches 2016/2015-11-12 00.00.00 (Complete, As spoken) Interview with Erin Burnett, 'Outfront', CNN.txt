ERIN BURNETT: So I want to ask you about the immigration (INAUDIBLE) going on out there. You put immigration front and center in the GOP conversation.

DONALD TRUMP: You wouldn't be talking about immigration if it wasn't for me.

ERIN BURNETT: You put it on the table. And now, of course, you were criticized heavily at debate, right, Kasich, Jeb Bush, saying that your proposal --

DONALD TRUMP: Well, they are weak people. Excuse me, they are weak people. I watched Jeb today. They are weak people. And Kasich has made a fool of himself in the debate.

ERIN BURNETT: The question I'm asking, though, is how do you take 11 million people and make them move?

DONALD TRUMP: You do it through a process. You do it in a very humane manner.

ERIN BURNETT: But they don't want to leave, you have to hire people to find them and get them --

DONALD TRUMP: First of all, they are here illegally. If a person comes across the border and you send them right back, the border patrol sends them right back. There isn't a big court situation to send them back.

ERIN BURNETT: Yes, but what about the guys --

DONALD TRUMP: Excuse me.

What's the difference between somebody that comes over the border for two days and gets caught in (INAUDIBLE) and somebody who comes over the border, he is here for a year and you bring him back? There is no difference. Illegal immigration each year costs us between $200 and $300 billion. I don't know if anyone gives you those numbers, probably not. But -- and when you include crime and other problems, it's more than that. So you are talking about between 200 and 300 billion the way it is now, alright?

ERIN BURNETT: But they pay in taxes --

DONALD TRUMP: Who pays in taxes? Do you believe --?

ERIN BURNETT: They pay Social Security, state and local.

DONALD TRUMP: Yes, what percentage of them, ten percent?

ERIN BURNETT: It's 24 billion a year --

DONALD TRUMP: Excuse me. Excuse me. Do you know how few pay taxes, Erin? Don't be naive. Do you think that an illegal immigrant, getting money is going to be paying taxes?

ERIN BURNETT: So on this point about humanity, though, are you going to be sending in officers --?

DONALD TRUMP: We are going to be sending in people --

(CROSSTALK)

We are going to be giving notice. We are going to be saying you have to go back to wherever the country is. I mean, it is going to countries, all different countries.

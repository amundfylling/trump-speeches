MIKA BRZEZINSKI: Joining us now, the presumptive Republican nominee for president, Donald Trump.

Donald, are you there?

DONALD TRUMP: I am. Good morning.

MIKA BRZEZINSKI: Good morning. How are you doing?

JOE SCARBOROUGH: You have been up early this morning.

DONALD TRUMP: I always get up early.

JOE SCARBOROUGH: You get up early. You're tweeting early, Donald.

DONALD TRUMP: I get up early. I get up nice and early.

JOE SCARBOROUGH: Why are you tweeting early, Donald?

DONALD TRUMP: Because I like tweeting. Because I like getting the word out.

JOE SCARBOROUGH: Yeah. What word do you want to get out this morning?

DONALD TRUMP: Well, I think I have gotten the word out. You know, Hillary said some things and I said some things and now I go and I go back to work and I have a lot of fun.

JOE SCARBOROUGH: Sounds like it. So let's talk about a couple of polls that have been out the past couple days. The Fox poll that has you up a couple points. Then you've got this "New York Times " poll that has Hillary up a couple points. But it looks like it's getting tight, the national race is getting tight between you two.

DONALD TRUMP: Well, (INAUDIBLE) had a poll that had me up by, I think, 5 points yesterday. So we're doing well. We're doing really well. Getting tremendous crowds and enthusiasm. It's sort of interesting because I talk about Hillary's bad judgment. I actually said that this morning to a lot of followers. And a lot of people that agree with me. But she's got horrible judgment. And you look at what's going on and...

JOE SCARBOROUGH: What's the worst example of her, you say she has horrible judgment.

DONALD TRUMP: Well, I could tell you a lot of examples, but one of them is Libya. Libya was an example. Libya is a disaster and by the way, just in case you have any questions, right now ISIS has taken the oil from Libya. So we knock out Libya and you knock out Gadhafi and she thinks we did a great job. And it's just more destabilization, a total disaster -- and ISIS has the oil.

JOE SCARBOROUGH: Would you have stayed out of Libya?

DONALD TRUMP: I would have stayed out of Libya. Yeah. I would have stayed our of Iraq too.

JOE SCARBOROUGH: And will you stay out of Syria?

DONALD TRUMP: I would have stayed out of Syria and I wouldn't have fought so much for Assad, against Assad, because I thought that was a whole thing. I mean, we have -- you have Iran, which we made into a power. Iran now is a power because of us, because of some of the dumbest deals I have ever seen.

So now you have Iran -- excuse me -- so now you have Iran and you have Russia in favor of Assad and we're supposed to fight the two of them. And at the same time, we're supposed to fight ISIS, who is fighting Assad.

JOE SCARBOROUGH: So there are a lot of people that say you have inconsistent foreign policy, but it sounds pretty consistent here -- you're -- as far as what you've just said this morning, you wouldn't have gone into Libya.

DONALD TRUMP: Right.

JOE SCARBOROUGH: You've said you wouldn't go into Iraq. You say you wouldn't go into Syria. You wouldn't have fought Assad.

DONALD TRUMP: But I would go after ISIS -- big league.

JOE SCARBOROUGH: But you would go after ISIS...

DONALD TRUMP: Right.

JOE SCARBOROUGH: Even if...

DONALD TRUMP: And, Joe, ISIS is fighting -- ISIS is fighting Syria. So you have some people -- most people -- they want to fight Syria and they want to fight ISIS at the same time and they are fighting each other.

JOE SCARBOROUGH: Right. So what you're saying is Assad can stay in power, that's not your interest. Your interest is...

DONALD TRUMP: No, what I'm saying is we have bigger problems than Assad.

JOE SCARBOROUGH: Yeah -- yeah -- what your interest is, though, militarily you tell the generals, go after ISIS, but we're not interested in replacing Assad.

DONALD TRUMP: I would say knock the hell out of ISIS, which we could have done originally. Knock the hell -- look, we shouldn't have been in Iraq. Bad decision. Then the way Obama got us out was a horrible decision, the way we came out. And I would have said -- and by the way, ISIS was created because of that. Because they wouldn't take them in. Because we had the wrong leadership. We put the wrong leadership on Iraq.

JOE SCARBOROUGH: Right -- but I want to get specific on Syria because there is a divided foreign policy community. There are people like Lindsey Graham who say you've got to replace Assad and beat ISIS.

There are others who are more realists who say, you know what, Assad is a horrible person but he stays there. Our job is getting rid of ISIS. Is that where you are?

DONALD TRUMP: That's where I am. And by the way, Lindsey Graham called me up the other day. He was very nice. That was a very surprising call. But he was very nice. But I disagree with him on this. Look, we have Iran and we have Russia totally on the side of Assad. And that's not the reason I stay out necessarily, but certainly it's a complicating factor. But we have them totally on the side of Assad. We have to knock the hell out of ISIS. And if we're going after Assad and ISIS and they're fighting each other, people are going to say what the hell are we doing.

JOE SCARBOROUGH: All right. One more foreign policy question. You know, people like myself have criticize Barack Obama, Republicans have for eight years, for not being good friends with our friends, but leaning over backwards to help our enemies, whether it's Iran or Cuba. This past week a lot of people confused because you're talking about -- sounding like Obama saying you would go to North Korea, you'd talk to the North Koreans. At the same time...

DONALD TRUMP: I wouldn't go to North Korea, Joe. I wouldn't go there.

JOE SCARBOROUGH: Or you would talk -- you would talk to them.

DONALD TRUMP: The last thing I do is go -- I would never go to North Korea. I don't know who would say I would go there.

JOE SCARBOROUGH: OK, you won't go there. You'll talk to the North Korean leader.

DONALD TRUMP: Yes, I would.

JOE SCARBOROUGH: Maybe he could go to your resort in Scotland and you all can talk there. But anyway, you talk to him, but then on the other side of it, you're attacking Great Britain, our longest running ally. Is there an inconsistency there?

DONALD TRUMP: I'm not attacking Great Britain. Where am I attacking Great Britain? I'm not attacking them at all. They asked me about the EU. I said, frankly, it's none of my business. And I don't even like asking it -- answering it, but, frankly, if I were Great Britain, I'd get out of the EU. I see what happened with the great migration destroying Europe and EU had a lot to do with that. Personally, I would get out but I said I don't want that to influence the people of Great Britain.

JOE SCARBOROUGH: Right. You -- you were going after David Cameron, though, their leader.

DONALD TRUMP: I don't go after -- you show me where. He came after me a little bit. And by the way, he would like me now to visit 10 Downing Street. They put out that invitation about two days ago. So I will do just fine with David Cameron. I think he's a nice guy. I will do just fine. But they have asked me to visit 10 Downing Street -- and I might do it.

MIKA BRZEZINSKI: Interesting.

JOE SCARBOROUGH: OK, well that's interesting. That's -- I thought I'd heard that you had said we might not have good relations with...

MIKA BRZEZINSKI: We're going to have good relationships. We'll have better relationships than we have right now, but all of these countries will not be taking advantage of us like they are right now. You look at what's going on with China and Japan and Mexico. Everybody takes advantage of the United States and we owe $19 trillion, going up to $21 trillion very soon.

JOE SCARBOROUGH: So Nabisco -- we heard you say Nabisco is going down to Mexico. You shouldn't have made an Oreo joke at Chris Christie's fund-raiser.

MIKA BRZEZINSKI: What's the Oreo joke? What's it...

JOE SCARBOROUGH: Come on, man. Chris is your friend.

(LAUGHTER)

DONALD TRUMP: You think what? You thought that was not appropriate?

JOE SCARBOROUGH: Well, I just don't think you should have made an Oreo joke to Chris Christie.

MIKA BRZEZINSKI: OK. I have a question. I have a question, Joe.

JOE SCARBOROUGH: OK.

MIKA BRZEZINSKI: Donald, we had former Defense Secretary and CIA Director Robert Gates on the show yesterday. I'm going to play for you a bit of what he had to say.

He had concerns about both candidates, you and Hillary Clinton. Take a listen.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

ROBERT GATES: I think they are especially apprehensive about the unpredictability and the threats of Mr. Trump. And some of the things he has said, from having Japan and South Korea have nuclear weapons to breaking off the relationship with China and so on and so forth. These are all serious concerns.

And the problem -- the worry is that even before the election, countries begin to take steps to offset these dangers, or these perceived shifts in U.S. policy, in ways that put greater distance between ourselves and them in terms of cooperation in the future.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

MIKA BRZEZINSKI: And Donald, I want to know what you think of those comments?

DONALD TRUMP: Well, the comments are wrong, because he knows nothing about me. He knows nothing about what I said. I'm not a big fan of his, by the way, because you take a look at two things.

Look at where our country is with years of him being involved. We are a mess, number one. I know he has a great reputation and all of that. All of these guys have a great reputation. They have been doing this stuff for 15 years. Look where our country is, OK? We need a new group with better thinking.

Number two, as far as Japan and South Korea are concerned. All I'm saying is we defend them. They are paying us a tiny fraction of what it's costing. We -- I want them to pay. I would love to continue to defend Japan. I would love to continue to defend South Korea. We have 28,000 soldiers on the line between North and South Korea right now.

It is costing us an absolute fortune, which we don't have. We're a debtor nation. I would like them to pay up. They have a lot of money, both of those nations. We take in Japan's cars by the millions. South Korea sells us, every time you buy televisions...

JOE SCARBOROUGH: So, you don't have a problem with the troops staying there. You just want Japan and South Korea to pay us for their presence.

DONALD TRUMP: I want them to pay up.

JOE SCARBOROUGH: Fair enough.

DONALD TRUMP: Because we are not a country -- this isn't 40 years ago and 20 years ago.

JOE SCARBOROUGH: Right.

DONALD TRUMP: We are not a country that can afford to defend Saudi Arabia, Germany, the NATO nations, 28 NATO nations, many of which are not paying us and they're not living up to their agreement.

JOE SCARBOROUGH: No.

DONALD TRUMP: Japan, South Korea, nobody, we're like the dummies that protect everybody. All I'm saying is, we have to get reimbursed because we can't afford it.

JOE SCARBOROUGH: Pay up.

MIKA BRZEZINSKI: OK, but Donald...

DONALD TRUMP: And nobody says that. And Bob Gates, who I don't know at all, but Bob Gates has no idea. See, they're misrepresenting it, he's misrepresenting it.

MIKA BRZEZINSKI: So Bob Gates is one of the greatest foreign policy minds in history. And I think the worry...

DONALD TRUMP: Oh, really, why? Because we're doing so well? You mean, you think we're doing well with his foreign policy, Mika?

MIKA BRZEZINSKI: Donald -- I think -- I think the worry also is just how you will be as president and present your positions and your words, and there are some concerns that you might be trigger-happy with your words. Like, for example...

DONALD TRUMP: Oh, really?

MIKA BRZEZINSKI: Yes.

DONALD TRUMP: I'm the one that didn't want to go into Iraq, Mika.

MIKA BRZEZINSKI: I'm -- even talking about for example the tweet that you sent out yesterday morning.

DONALD TRUMP: What's wrong with them?

MIKA BRZEZINSKI: I will tell you that some might say.

DONALD TRUMP: Go ahead.

MIKA BRZEZINSKI: That it was very much generating hatred, focusing on the hatred and fear that terrorism brings to the American people. And maybe perhaps that first tweet...

DONALD TRUMP: Well, you feel that way, but I -- I said another plane was blown up and I can practically guarantee who blew it up. And another plane went down...

MIKA BRZEZINSKI: But listen -- listen -- Donald listen to yourself right now.

DONALD TRUMP: And let me tell you, the -- the mind set of a weak Hillary Clinton, which is four more years of Obama is not going to do it for our country, Mika.

MIKA BRZEZINSKI: Yeah. And I'm asking you if there is any, perhaps backing here to the concern, that a lot of what you say is focused on hatred and fear, and sort of generating more anger and churning it up.

And perhaps for example that tweet, maybe you might have thought of the families that were suffering first.

DONALD TRUMP: No, I'll tell you what. Let me tell you what I'm thinking of. I'm thinking of the future.

We can't continue to let things like this happen. We are being taken advantage of by radical Islamic terrorists, and we are -- this world is changing. And another couple planes go down, Mika, and you're going to have a depression world-wide, the likes of which you have never seen.

Because nobody is going to travel. There will be no anything. There will be no communication between countries. And you will have a problem the likes of which you have never seen.

And I will tell you four more years of a weak Hillary Clinton and that's what she is, four more years of that, it will not work. It will not work.

And all I did is point it out.

JOE SCARBOROUGH: Right.

DONALD TRUMP: And I said, when you find out what happened to the plane, it will be exactly what I said. That plane didn't go down because of mechanical failure.

JOE SCARBOROUGH: Right.

MIKA BRZEZINSKI: I'm not saying it did.

JOE SCARBOROUGH: Yes. Right. Speaking of not working, let's go to the guy who when I'm not working 90 percent of the time...

MIKA BRZEZINSKI: He's just walking around.

JOE SCARBOROUGH: He's in charge. I kind of just walk around.

WILLIE GEIST: Nice, headed into a good segue. Hey Donald, it's Willie.

DONALD TRUMP: Hi Willie.

WILLIE GEIST: Good to talk to you this morning. I want to ask you about something you said last night at Chris Christie's fund-raiser, which is quote, "Who the hell cares if there's a trade war. You have been open about a 35 percent tariff on exports from China and from Mexico. Most experts believe that would plunge China and Mexico into a recession.

DONALD TRUMP: Oh really?

WILLIE GEIST: Could perhaps put the United States into a recession.

DONALD TRUMP: Oh you think so? I don't think so.

WILLIE GEIST: Are you concerned about the jobs that will be lost in this country because of a trade war?

DONALD TRUMP: OK. No. OK. Ready? So, China, we have a trade deficit with China of $505 billion this year.

WILLIE GEIST: Right.

DONALD TRUMP: We have a trade deficit with Mexico, $58 billion. Not only that, they are killing us at the border and everything else. We all know that. The drugs are pouring across, etcetera. People are coming across. Everybody is coming across, all right. They do nothing to help us.

And they will. They will end up being very good neighbors. We'll have a good relationship if I'm in there. But when we have a trade deficit with China of over $500 billion a year, I say, let there be something because they are taking advantage of us, OK? We can't do any worse. So, if we had a trade war, to be honest with you, it can't be worse than having a trade deficit of $505 billion.

And I say that loud and I say it clear. And let me tell you what will happen. When we get tough with China, they will stop devaluing their currency which is the biggest way that they beat us. That's their number one tool. They are absolutely killing us by devaluing their currency.

WILLIE GEIST: Donald.

DONALD TRUMP: They are absolutely making it impossible for our companies to compete with China. And by doing that, it's taking our jobs away. I mean, look at our country. Look at the jobs -- the real job situation, not the phony job, with the 5 percent stuff. Lock at the real job situation. If I go out and I see communities that have been stripped of their jobs.

WILLIE GEIST: Donald, do you believe though, if you put that tariff on Chinese exports it would put the Chinese economy into a recession?

DONALD TRUMP: No I don't.

WILLIE GEIST: You don't. OK.

DONALD TRUMP: And I'm not sure you'd ever have to do it. Look, I have been contacted by top people in China and so has the United States government by the way. And they are concerned with me. And guess what they are going to do? They are going to negotiate. They are not concerned with Obama because they have been ripping off our country for eight years with Obama.

They are very concerned with me. And they want to figure out what's going on. And I can tell you, top people have talked to me and they said, boy, you have China in a very interesting position. They want to negotiate, Donald. I said, I know, because that's what I do. That's what I do frankly, better than anybody else.

WILLIE GEIST: So, that's...

DONALD TRUMP: And when you have a guy like a Bob Gates that's been running foreign policy, I mean, he's been in so many administrations, I will tell you another thing I don't like about Bob Gates. Whether it's Obama or anybody else, and even Obama. When he writes a book and says bad things about everybody that he worked for, I don't like the kind of guys that write books and say bad about everybody they work for.

(CROSSTALK)

JOE SCARBOROUGH: All right. We're going to put him down as undecided for Bob Gates for vice president.

MIKA BRZEZINSKI: Yes.

DONALD TRUMP: I don't care.

WILLIE GEIST: I know.

JOE SCARBOROUGH: We heard you.

DONALD TRUMP: I'm just telling you. I don't like that. But more importantly...

JOE SCARBOROUGH: Donald...

DONALD TRUMP: ... I don't like where our country is and he's been there for many years.

WILLIE GEIST: Right.

JOE SCARBOROUGH: Well, you know what...

MIKA BRZEZINSKI: I, kind of...

JOE SCARBOROUGH: He's kind of had commander-in-chief strapped around him.

MIKA BRZEZINSKI: I dare to disagree.

JOE SCARBOROUGH: I mean, you think things are bad now? Just think about how bad they would have been if he weren't there trying to resist the worst instincts of our last two commanders-in-chiefs.

MIKA BRZEZINSKI: Yes.

DONALD TRUMP: Well, I think things are very bad now.

MIKA BRZEZINSKI: OK.

JOE SCARBOROUGH: Yes.

MIKA BRZEZINSKI: Donald, you're like my dad, right?

DONALD TRUMP: And I think they're very bad world-wide. I think the world is a mess.

JOE SCARBOROUGH: All right. Let's go. Donald...

MIKA BRZEZINSKI: Like my dad...

JOE SCARBOROUGH: We're running out of time. And we've got to get around the table.

WILLIE GEIST: Yes, I just want a -- I want a quick button on this, because that was an important thing you just said and very interesting. That the 35 percent tariff you proposed may just be a negotiating tool and you may not ever implement it.

DONALD TRUMP: Well, I hate to say that, because I hate to tell China there that. But you know what? I will tell China right now. I will implement it if they don't behave and they are not behaving. They are devaluing their currency. Recently, nine months ago, they gave the biggest devaluation in the history -- the biggest in 20 years, in two decades. And, they are not behaving. They are not playing fair.

JOE SCARBOROUGH: All right. So, Donald...

DONALD TRUMP: And on top of that, they are building a major fortress in the South China Sea, which they're not supposed to be doing.

JOE SCARBOROUGH: All right. So, I'm just going to say it for everybody. So, just so China knows, Donald is going to put on like an 80 percent tariff. He's going to...

DONALD TRUMP: Don't joke, Joe. I mean, you're having -- hey Joe. You're having a lot of fun.

JOE SCARBOROUGH: Hold on! Hold -- Donald, let me finish! Let me finish Donald! You have got to let me finish.

DONALD TRUMP: OK. Don't joke Joe.

JOE SCARBOROUGH: You've got to let me get to the second part of what I was going to say. For all you economics professors and people writing op-eds...

MIKA BRZEZINSKI: He's negotiating.

JOE SCARBOROUGH: .. and fretting freaking out, he's negotiating. This entire campaign. Look what he did to the Republican party. He battered them. He abused them. They came whimpering to him like a beaten dog, licking his foot, begging him to please, just pet him. It's what he does. It's called hard nose negotiating.

(CROSSTALK)

DONALD TRUMP: I will say one thing. The Republican party is really coming together...

JOE SCARBOROUGH: Yes, they are.

DONALD TRUMP: ... and really unifying. And people are endorsing me now...

JOE SCARBOROUGH: Yes, they are.

DONALD TRUMP: ... that frankly, I was a little bit surprised to see some of the people that are endorsing me.

JOE SCARBOROUGH: Frankly, I was surprised at how quickly it happened.

NICOLLE WALLACE: Mr. Trump, you're running against a rigged political system and a rigged economy. Bernie Sanders is running against a rigged political system and a rigged economy.

You have a lot of animosity and distrust for Hillary Clinton. Bernie Sanders clearly has a lot of animosity and distrust in Hillary Clinton. Would you take a few minutes to talk to him and consider him as your running mate?

DONALD TRUMP: Oh wow. That's a great question. You know, the one thing that Bernie Sanders and I have in common, two things. And I do have much bigger crowds than him, but that's OK. But we have the crowds.

NICOLLE WALLACE: It's also sir. With all due respect, it's close.

DONALD TRUMP: I actually do. Joe knows that and Mika knows that. But, he is second, I will say that. He's above any other Republican.

JOE SCARBOROUGH: He is.

DONALD TRUMP: But, I will say this. We have one thing very strongly in common. We know that the United States is being taken advantage horribly on trade deals. The difference between Bernie and myself is that I know how to make those trade deals fantastic and he doesn't. He has no clue.

NICOLLE WALLACE: But if you're number two, he could watch and learn from you.

DONALD TRUMP: Yes, but he's got too many other things in the bag, no. But I will tell you, Nicolle, and I mean this 100 percent. And you saw that in many of the primaries when they do the polls.

If Bernie loses, which he will because his system is rigged very badly, frankly, he should run as an independent. Bernie should definitely run as an independent. But, Bernie, his people are going to vote -- big percentages of the Bernie people are going to vote for Trump. You watch.

MIKA BRZEZINSKI: All right, Donald trump.

JOE SCARBOROUGH: Donald Trump, thank you.

DONALD TRUMP: Thank you.

WILLIE GEIST: Thanks, Donald.

DONALD TRUMP: Thank you very much.

JOE SCARBOROUGH: Wow.

NICOLLE WALLACE: Good day.

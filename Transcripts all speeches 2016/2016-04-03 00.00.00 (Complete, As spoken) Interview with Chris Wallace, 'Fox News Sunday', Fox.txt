CHRIS WALLACE: Mr. Trump, welcome back to "Fox News Sunday."

DONALD TRUMP: Thank you.

CHRIS WALLACE: This may sound harsh, but are you in the process of blowing your campaign for president?

DONALD TRUMP: I don't think so. I just got great polls from NBC nationwide. I think that we're doing very well.

Don't forget, you have been thinking about that or given me that question numerous times over the last, since June 16th.

I've had that statement made many times -- "he just blew his campaign" -- only to end up having higher poll numbers.

CHRIS WALLACE: But you like to talk about polls, let's talk about some. In a Wisconsin poll a month ago, you were leading Cruz by 10 points. In the same poll, the Marquette poll, out this week, you're now trailing Cruz by 10 points.

In the latest Fox poll, 67 percent of women nationally now have an unfavorable view of you.

If you had purposely set out to turn off voters, especially women voters over the last two weeks, I'm not sure you could have done a better job.

DONALD TRUMP: Well, you know, all I can do is do what I do. I'm self-funding my campaign. I'm not one of these politicians that's being controlled by the people that give them money. Believe me, they are totally controlled.

I think I'm doing very well. Was this my best week? I guess not. I could have done without the retweet, etcetera, etcetera, but I think I'm doing OK.

CHRIS WALLACE: I want to talk to you about -- I want to talk to you about that. First of all, Wisconsin. How important is Wisconsin? How big a setback if you don't win there?

DONALD TRUMP: Well, I'd like to win it. Is it a big setback? I would like to win it.

CHRIS WALLACE: Do you think it would jeopardize your ability to get to 1,237?

DONALD TRUMP: It would always be better to win. I think I get there anyway, but I like Wisconsin, I like the people of Wisconsin, I think they like me, I've had tremendous crowds. We've had a tremendous response, and I think I'm going to do very well in Wisconsin.

CHRIS WALLACE: You say you've had better weeks. Let's talk about your comments this week, about what you would like to see if abortions became illegal. Here you are.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Do you believe in punishment for abortion, yes or no, as a principle?

DONALD TRUMP: The answer is that there has to be some sort of punishment.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: For the woman?

DONALD TRUMP: Yes. There has to be some form.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

CHRIS WALLACE: It took you two written statements to clean that up.

DONALD TRUMP: Well, it took me really two statements because they were sort of different statements and they were on different subjects.

CHRIS WALLACE: But then the president of National Right to Life tweeted this, "The inept thing Donald Trump said about women who have abortions is making pro-lifers cringe."

You did something pretty remarkable. You offended both the pro-life and the pro-choice movements with one statement.

DONALD TRUMP: Well, look, it was asked as a hypothetical, and talked about if it's illegal, and it was hypothetically asked.

CHRIS WALLACE: But you gave that answer.

DONALD TRUMP: There would have been -- there would have been a very strong conservative, a very conservative group that would have said that was the appropriate answer. I'm not saying it was the appropriate answer. I'd say it's the doctor's fault or whoever performs the act, it's their fault.

But there was a time when that would have been, and maybe today that would have been, but that was asked as a hypothetical question.

CHRIS WALLACE: But why did you say the woman?

DONALD TRUMP: Because it was asked hypothetically. I said the woman because it was asked hypothetically. I also corrected it and I made it very much so that I think everybody, it's acceptable now for everybody. But --

(CROSSTALK)

CHRIS WALLACE: Do you agree it was a mistake?

DONALD TRUMP: Well, I -- as a hypothetical question, I would have rather asked it -- you know, answered it in a different manner, yes. I would have rather answered it in a different manner.

CHRIS WALLACE: The growing knock on you, and you read everything, so you know this is what people are saying, is that you haven't thought these things through. You haven't studied, that you wing it too often.

Do you think that's fair?

DONALD TRUMP: Well, let me just tell you. I've been a really successful businessman for a long time. I was never asked many questions.

Like I was asked a question about NATO the other day by Wolf Blitzer. I think I gave a great answer. I said, it's obsolete, we spend too much money, we're not getting the benefits that we should be getting for the money. We're carrying a lot of countries, you have 28 countries, 68 years old. We are not being treated fairly by the world and I mean that.

I've been a politician now for eight months.

CHRIS WALLACE: I understand.

DONALD TRUMP: I'm going to straighten out the country. We're going to make America great again. Politicians can't do that. I've been a politician for a very short period of time.

I announced --

CHRIS WALLACE: So, what are you saying, you've still got a learning curve?

DONALD TRUMP: There's always a learning curve. I don't care if you've been doing it all your life, there's a learning curve, especially with something like you're talking about NATO, when you're talking about -- because it is a very movable subject.

I will say this: NATO is obsolete. NATO doesn't cover terrorism. NATO was based around the Soviet Union.

CHRIS WALLACE: Wait, wait, OK, I was --

(CROSSTALK)

DONALD TRUMP: No, no, but it's important to know, because when I talk about --

(CROSSTALK)

CHRIS WALLACE: OK, fine. Do you know how many NATO soldiers have died in Afghanistan helping us after the 9/11 attack on the U.S.? Do you know how many NATO soldiers have died?

DONALD TRUMP: I'm not saying -- I'm not saying it's a bad thing. I'm saying it's unfair --

CHRIS WALLACE: A thousand is the answer.

DONALD TRUMP: Fine, I'm saying -- and it's a lot of soldiers. I'm saying it's a -- I'm saying it's unfair to us. It's unfair to us as a country.

CHRIS WALLACE: But they've been defending us against terrorism.

DONALD TRUMP: Excuse me. We are paying so much money, disproportionately. We have countries that are being carried along.

It's not fair to the United States, not fair to the citizens, and not fair to the taxpayers. And what I said was exactly right.

Now when they cover it, they say, Donald Trump doesn't like NATO. I think NATO's fine. I think NATO has to be readjusted. I think we have to cover terrorism, because we're really not covering terrorism.

CHRIS WALLACE: Well, in Afghanistan we are.

DONALD TRUMP: Sure. But, we --

CHRIS WALLACE: Well, that counts, sir.

DONALD TRUMP: We have to -- excuse me. I'm sure it counts.

But I'm saying, we have to be very specific on terrorism. NATO is no specific to terrorism.

Why are we taking the burden of the cost when big beneficiaries are paying very little? And the reason is because they're ripping off the United States, just like everybody else that does business with us. They're ripping off our country, and that's why we owe $19 trillion.

CHRIS WALLACE: You talk about the fact that you've only been a politician for eight months, but there are other issues that you've gotten in trouble on in the last week or so that have more to do with just judgment and temperament. For instance, the fact that you spent days going after Ted Cruz's wife and her looks --

DONALD TRUMP: Excuse me, excuse me. Ted Cruz --

CHRIS WALLACE: Let me just ask --

DONALD TRUMP: Ted Cruz came after me --

CHRIS WALLACE: No, he didn't.

DONALD TRUMP: Well, he did through my wife.

CHRIS WALLACE: No, he didn't.

DONALD TRUMP: He took a picture --

CHRIS WALLACE: No, he didn't.

DONALD TRUMP: Oh, of course he did, of course he did.

CHRIS WALLACE: Do you have any evidence that he knew about the attack by the independent super PAC?

DONALD TRUMP: My evidence is total common sense. He knew those people, those people are 100 percent for them, they coordinated together. I have no doubt about it in a million years. He did that attack -- and this was just --

CHRIS WALLACE: Even if it he did it, was it worth you spending --

(CROSSTALK)

DONALD TRUMP: No, I would say probably not. If I had it to do again, I probably wouldn't have sent it. I didn't think it was particularly bad, but I probably wouldn't have sent it.

But this was a response. This wasn't me starting something, this was a response.

CHRIS WALLACE: The Michelle Fields battery case, your campaign manager said he never touched her, you said she made it up. Then, one of your surveillance videos, I've got to say, you've got your places covered showed --

DONALD TRUMP: I am very well covered.

(CROSSTALK)

And I was very happy to give them that tape.

CHRIS WALLACE: To show the fact that he didn't touch her, and then you said this.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

DONALD TRUMP: I think it's something that's disgraceful. I think that you, as a reporter, and all of you as a reporter, probably get treated a lot rougher than that on a daily basis.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

I agree with it.

CHRIS WALLACE: Question: why not just apologize to her?

DONALD TRUMP: Because --

CHRIS WALLACE: I mean, he did grab her.

DONALD TRUMP: Because let me tell you why: loyal person, number one.

CHRIS WALLACE: I'm not saying you fire him.

DONALD TRUMP: And when she wrote out, early on, before she knew she was on tape, that it was that she was practically thrown to the ground, I mean, I wish I had it here, I'd read her statement --

CHRIS WALLACE: I know what she said.

DONALD TRUMP: That didn't happen. OK? Do you agree with that?

CHRIS WALLACE: I agree with you. But why not just apologize --

DONALD TRUMP: Excuse me, Chris, no, but she lied. Do you agree that she lied?

CHRIS WALLACE: I think she completely misrepresented it early on. I do.

DONALD TRUMP: Early on is all that matters.

CHRIS WALLACE: But why turn one day into two weeks?

DONALD TRUMP: Chris -- well, at least it shows I'm loyal, because the easiest thing for me to do would have been to destroy that man's life. And I would have fired him immediately. Had she fallen to the ground, or almost fallen to the ground like she said -- she didn't even change the expression on her face. She kept walking.

CHRIS WALLACE: So, you have no regrets about letting this thing go on for two weeks?

DONALD TRUMP: Chris, I think, frankly, I don't think she would have accepted that. I think she would have used that as ammunition against.

A lot of times, when you apologize, they use it as ammunition against.

The easier thing would have been, Corey, you're fired. You're not very good at that, OK? But I don't want to ruin him.

The man has a wife and four beautiful children. He lives in New Hampshire, he's a good person. I don't want to destroy him.

CHRIS WALLACE: You weighed in this week on foreign policy national security. Here is what you said about Japan and South Korea defending themselves against North Korea. Here it is.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

ANDERSON COOPER: So you have no problem Japan and South Korea having nuclear weapons?

DONALD TRUMP: At some point, we have to say, you know what, we're better off if Japan protects itself against this maniac in North Korea. We're better off, frankly, if South Korea is going to start to protect itself --

(END VIDEO CLIP)

What do they have to pay us? We're defending Japan. We can't afford it. We're a better nation.

CHRIS WALLACE: I understand that. But that's the question -- that's not the question. The question is, letting them develop their own nuclear program.

For more than half a century, U.S. policy has been that we protect those countries with our nuclear umbrella so they don't --

DONALD TRUMP: And lose a fortune.

CHRIS WALLACE: I understand, but the idea is not to have a nuclear arms race in the Northern Pacific, on the Korean peninsula.

DONALD TRUMP: Are you ready?

CHRIS WALLACE: You want to throw that all away.

DONALD TRUMP: Are you ready? No, no, I'm not throwing anything away. This is common sense. This is like trade. We lose on every trade deal.

Sometimes you're better off saying, hey, wait a minute. We're defending Japan, we're -- I mean, what we're doing is costing us a fortune, and not only Japan, South Korea. We have 28,000 soldiers on the line. And part of that defense is nukes, right?

At some point, they have to pay us, because we cannot continue --

CHRIS WALLACE: But they do pay us.

DONALD TRUMP: They pay us peanuts.

CHRIS WALLACE: They pay us almost $1 billion, South Korea. I think $2 billion in Japan.

DONALD TRUMP: That's peanuts compared to what we're talking about and compared to the real threat.

CHRIS WALLACE: You want to have a nuclear arms race on the Korean peninsula?

DONALD TRUMP: In many ways, and I say this, in many ways, the world is changing. Right now, you have Pakistan and you have North Korea and you have China and you have Russia and you have India and you have the United States and many other countries have nukes.

CHRIS WALLACE: Understood.

DONALD TRUMP: It's not like, gee whiz, nobody has them.

So, North Korea has nukes. Japan has a problem with that. I mean, they have a big problem with that. Maybe they would in fact be better off if they defend themselves from North Korea.

CHRIS WALLACE: With nukes?

DONALD TRUMP: Maybe they would be better off -- including with nukes, yes, including with nukes.

CHRIS WALLACE: In South Korea, with nukes?

DONALD TRUMP: South Korea is right next door, just so you understand.

CHRIS WALLACE: But that means you can have a nuclear arms race on the Korean Peninsula.

DONALD TRUMP: You already have it, Chris. You already have a nuclear arms race.

When a guy like Kasich gets up and talks about, Trump wants to give everybody missiles -- I don't want to give missiles. And by the way, I'd leave it the way it is, ideally.

My number one choice is, leave it the way it is, but they have to pay us because we cannot afford to continue to lose the billions and billions of dollars that we're losing in order to defend Japan and Germany and South Korea and Saudi Arabia.

CHRIS WALLACE: This week, you said you no longer continue to pledge that you will support the Republican nominee for president. Then on Thursday, you had a meeting with the RNC that you said was very nice and they treated you well.

So, are you pledging to support the nominee or not?

DONALD TRUMP: I will be looking at who the nominee is and I think people will be very happy with my decision.

CHRIS WALLACE: But here's the point. In South Carolina, it turns out, you took a pledge to support the nominee. If you break that pledge, then you lose all those delegates.

So, are you going to keep the pledge or not?

DONALD TRUMP: What the real point I made, and that whole transaction or, you know, talking point that you're talking about, was that I release Ted Cruz. He does not have to endorse me if I win. I think I'm going to win, but he doesn't have to endorse me. I don't need his support.

I have the support of the people.

CHRIS WALLACE: But you still need their support if you're going to beat the Democrats.

(CROSSTALK)

DONALD TRUMP: Look, I was very popular in North Carolina.

CHRIS WALLACE: Don't you want a united party?

DONALD TRUMP: I'd like to see a united party, but I also watched the turmoil in his brain when they were talking about Trump and support and, well, I don't, oh, you know, he's going crazy.

All I want to do is relieve the pressure. This man does not react well under pressure. I've watched him. He's a basket case.

So, in order to relieve the pressure, I'm telling you, Ted, don't worry about it, you don't have to endorse me.

CHRIS WALLACE: Are you ruling out running as an independent third party candidate? Are you ruling that out?

DONALD TRUMP: Look, I'm by far the frontrunner as a Republican. I want to run as a Republican. I will beat Hillary Clinton.

CHRIS WALLACE: But if you don't get the nomination?

DONALD TRUMP: We're going to have to see how I was treated. I'm going to have to see how I was treated. Very simple.

CHRIS WALLACE: So you're not ruling it out?

DONALD TRUMP: I just want to be treated -- it's not a question of win or lose. It's a question of treatment. I want to be treated fair.

CHRIS WALLACE: After the last two weeks, after all of these controversies, and plans to change your campaign? Any plans to lay off the personal attacks? Any plans, maybe, to study some of these issues more?

DONALD TRUMP: Originally when I went out with 17 people, we're down now to three. I have two leftovers, OK? I call them leftovers. They haven't been nice to me.

I will beat them. After I beat them, I'm going to be so presidential, you're going to be so bored, you're going to say, this is the most boring human being I've ever interviewed.

CHRIS WALLACE: Mr. Trump --

DONALD TRUMP: Thank you.

CHRIS WALLACE: It's always interesting. I don't think you could be dull even if you wanted to be.

DONALD TRUMP: Well, I think I may act very presidential, I'll be dull. But that will be fine.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Well, Donald Trump, of course, remains the strong frontrunner up here to win the Republican primary in New Hampshire tomorrow. That is UMass tracking poll. Shows the man leading the field with 34 percent. Look at that, a hefty lead. Everyone else is way back, 21 points behind, all bunched together and fighting with each other. Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, John Kasich, Jeb Bush, Chris Christie, all in one circular firing squad.

That must have been one nice thing at the debate the other night. You walk in, and everybody was fighting with each other and ignoring you.

DONALD TRUMP: Well, I didn't know what happened exactly. I was just sort of standing there watching everybody go wild. I was very happy about it. That's OK with me.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: What did you make of Marco Rubio doing an imitation from "The Blade Runner"? He just started repeating himself, repeating himself. Six times! He repeated. Whole speaks parts. What was it --

DONALD TRUMP: I was standing right next to him. I don't know what it was. But I was standing right there. And he's a nice guy. He's been very nice to me, I must say. But I heard it once. I heard it a second time. I have, like, a good memory. Then I heard it a third time. I said, I think it was the exact same thing. It wasn't even like, I know you've replayed it. And then after the fifth time, I said, I wonder if he's going to do it once more. But it was a little bit --

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Hang in there. Let me ask you about -- talk to the voter for a minute here. Don't use up too much time. It's snowing up here now. It snows in New Hampshire. People know how to put -- get -- cars. They got -- will put chains on now they don't have good tires. Why should they trudge through the snow for Donald Trump?

DONALD TRUMP: Well, you know, my whole concept and my whole theme, frankly, behind it is make America great again, Chris. We're going to strengthen up our borders. We're not going to let the drugs pour in. New Hampshire has a unbelievable heroin problem and drug problem.

We're going to build up our military. Nobody's going to mess with us. We're going to take care of our vets. We're going to get rid of Obamacare like you and I discussed it. I mean, whether you like it or don't like it, it's tremendous what's happening in terms of the increases. Twenty-five, 35, 45 percent increases in Obamacare. It's unheard of.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Let's talk about how you get it done. Now, we know about the wall. We know about your -- I think it appeals to a lot of people. But here's what happens. You get inaugurated. You take the oath. You have the ball, the party. That night you come back to the Oval Office. You get a call from the speaker of the House. Say it's Paul Ryan. "You know, Mr. Trump, I think that idea of yours of building a wall is disgraceful. I won't even bring it up for a vote. What do you do?"

DONALD TRUMP: I'm going to get it done, Chris. I'm --

CHRIS MATTHEWS: No, he'll just say to you, I'm not bringing it up.

DONALD TRUMP: He may say that, but he may also go along with me a hundred percent. And I think that my history is that I cajole, and I get people to do what they have to do.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: What are your tools?

DONALD TRUMP: Washington -- me. Washington is in gridlock right now. You understand --

CHRIS MATTHEWS: No, I know all about this. And I know how things don't get done.

(CROSSTALK)

DONALD TRUMP: It's time. And when you see Congress, what is it, I think the last time I saw it, it was about nine percent.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: That's where it belongs.

DONALD TRUMP: OK, about nine. No, no, we're going to make things better. We're going to bring it up. We're going to get things done.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: OK, let's talk about your experience. When you put up a building in New York, and there it is, that big building on Fifth Avenue, Trump Tower --

DONALD TRUMP: Which they all said you could never get zoning.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Well, I know. Well, here's what -- I'm just -- I'm not into business. But I've heard about New York. I've got to pay a special percent, maybe five to the bad guys. You've got to deal with council man privilege, where some local councilman will stiff you just so he can get something out of you. Or you've got a labor union that's being very difficult.

What do you do? How do you scare them into doing what you want them to do? Or pay them off, or what do you do?

DONALD TRUMP: Where do you hear all these bad things?

CHRIS MATTHEWS: How do you get it done? How do you get it done?

DONALD TRUMP: I'm the king of zoning.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: But how do you do it? What's your technique? Fear? Bullying?

DONALD TRUMP: I deal with people. I hire experts. No. I hire people that are good --

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Do you pay these guys?

DONALD TRUMP: They're consultants and I --

CHRIS MATTHEWS: No, do you pay the --

DONALD TRUMP: I don't, no, I don't. The problem is if you do -- first of all, it's dishonest and I'm an honest guy. But if you do that, you know what happens? Everybody else comes along, and it never ends. If you don't do it, it's like the old story. You take care of building inspectors, all the building inspectors hear about it, they all come to you. I don't do it.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: What else have wise guys committed say you're not building?

DONALD TRUMP: Well, I've known tough cookies over the years.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: I mean wise guys.

DONALD TRUMP: I know what you mean by wise guys. I've known very tough people. I've known people that make the politicians that you and I deal with every day look like little babies. They'd walk across the street out of fear if they ever saw some of these guys. I deal with people that are very tough people, and I get it done. I deal with people that are heads of countries because I'm all over the world. My company is all over the world. I get along great with people.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: So, even guys like Mean Esposito in the old days of King --

(CROSSTALK)

DONALD TRUMP: He was great.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: He was great?! (LAUGHTER)

DONALD TRUMP: I'll tell you something. I knew him very well. Mean Esposito --

CHRIS MATTHEWS: He was the boss of Brooklyn.

DONALD TRUMP: Mean Esposito -- he was the boss. Mean Esposito, in his own way, was a very, very honest guy. When he gave you his word on something, it was done. I deal with politicians. They give you their word, it's like -- it means nothing. Mean Esposito in a certain way was a very honorable guy.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Let's talk about the race. You're a nationalist. Maybe don't know, but you saying things like either we have a company, country or we don't, I get it. It can be on immigration, jobs going overseas, best jobs to China, worst jobs to (INAUDIBLE). I get it all. Trade deals you don't like. You don't like the stupid wars we've had to fight.

So, you're the nationalist. You're up against a socialist. Who wins? Self-describe --

DONALD TRUMP: Oh, I think I'd beat him easy for one reason. When I start talking about tax rates, I would hit him so hard on taxes. You know, somebody's got to pay for it --

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Who would pay for the tuition for everybody? Who would pay --

(CROSSTALK)

DONALD TRUMP: You're going to pay, I'm going to pay, we'll all pay.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Who's going to pay for Medicare for life?

DONALD TRUMP: 95 percent taxes. That's what's going to pay, Chris. It's impossible. I would love to run against him. The only one I'd rather run against because a Fox poll just came out where I'm beating Hillary by five points. I would love to run against Hillary just because it's -- you know, it's more of a name. But there's no way you lose to Bernie. When you start going into the taxes. I'm actually surprised that Hillary isn't playing the tax card. And I'm a little surprised that Hillary continues to run --

(CROSSTALK)

CHRIS MATTHEWS: She's not playing any cards. Let me ask you about the old names. Why are the Clintons, both of them, having troubles this time? Bill on the campaign trail. Well, you basically pushed him out with that thing about sexist charges --

DONALD TRUMP: They have not said a bad thing about me since I said --

CHRIS MATTHEWS: I know. You've pushed him off the trail.

DONALD TRUMP: Were you impressed? Were you impressed?

CHRIS MATTHEWS: I'm impressed with stuff that works in this case.

Anyway, let's go about the -- the Clintons and the Bushes are nothing politically, right? They're having such a hard time out on the stump. You don't like Jeb. You've been awfully tough on him.

DONALD TRUMP: And I'll tell you why?

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Why don't you like a nice old guy?

DONALD TRUMP: I'll tell you why. He spent $20 million on ads against me, which he shouldn't have done. He should have focused on people that are ahead of him. But he spent $20 million, they're false ads and he says false things about me. I mean, he says so much. He talks about the Second Amendment. Nobody's stronger than Second Amendment than me. He would make it believe like I'm not. He brings up taxes. I have the biggest tax decrease of anybody else and he makes it sound like I'm going to eat it.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: What about the stadium?

DONALD TRUMP: He's really -- the stadium is another one. Eminent domain, thank you very domain. Eminent domain. He talks about me with eminent domain. It just came out this morning that his father and the group, the Bushes -- not him because he's not smart enough to do it, but his group used eminent domain to get the stadium bought -- the land around the stadium bought in Texas. So he's very embarrassed by it. Let me tell you. He's not going anywhere. He just announced he spent $120 million on the campaign. He just announced about 20 minutes ago that he's against now against super PACs. Well, he spent most of the money in his super PAC, and now he announces that he is against super PACs. It's really pretty --

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Let's talk about something that bugged me. You talked about torture. You didn't use the word; you talked about going further than waterboarding. You're going to be commander in chief if you win. You're responsible to every enlisted person in the Army and the -- You're responsible to all those guys. If they get captured, there's always been the concern in our government -- and the reason we don't torture prisoners, people in uniform, is because our guys are going to be captured. And we don't want them tortured.

Now aren't you worried, as commander-in-chief, that you will legitimize torture?

DONALD TRUMP: Came up in the debate. They asked Ted Cruz about waterboarding. And he was very tentative with that answer. I don't think he had a good night. He was very tentative with that answer. You saw that.

Then they looked to me. What do you think? I said, I'm all in favor. And I said the reason I'm in favor --

(CROSSTALK)

Well, I prefaced it by saying the reason I'm in favor is because they're chopping off heads. Not since medieval times -- you know, you and I used to study --

CHRIS MATTHEWS: By the way, it's not since The French Revolution they did a lot of guillotine --

DONALD TRUMP: All right, well, I used medieval times.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: They did, they did.

DONALD TRUMP: But not since I said --

CHRIS MATTHEWS: They've been drawing and quartering in England in the 19th century.

DONALD TRUMP: You're right, but you know, medieval times made more of an impression, I guess. But I said, not since medieval times have we talked about chopping off heads. I know the parents of James Foley. I see what --

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Let's talk about that guy. Because I carry his picture in my wallet. And I think we share that.

DONALD TRUMP: Great guy. Right.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: To me, he was a man of noble courage --

DONALD TRUMP: Great parents, by the way.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Noble courage right to the end. He saw what was happening to him, he knew he was going to reach his end on this earth.

DONALD TRUMP: I agree.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: He stood his ground and never buckled. What a great man.

DONALD TRUMP: A hundred percent.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Let me ask you -- suppose you got a call and you're a (INAUDIBLE) office at 3:00 in the morning and someone tells you, they just picked up one of our uniformed guys. They were embedded in an Iraqi unit. They get picked up by damned ISIS. They say they're going to chop his head up -- cut his head off in five days? What would you do? Five days max.

DONALD TRUMP: Well, the one thing I won't do because I think this is what you're getting at --

CHRIS MATTHEWS: No, I'm not getting at anything. I don't know the answer.

DONALD TRUMP: Well, they're tough answers. They're always tough answers.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Well, what's your answer?

DONALD TRUMP: The one thing you can't do is start taking care of people by giving money to get people out. Because once you do that, then everybody in this room (PH) is going to be gone. So, you can't do that. I mean, it's horrible to tell parents that. You know, like the parents of James Foley, who I love. I know them and I love them. They're great people.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Good for you.

DONALD TRUMP: And he was great.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: What would you do? If it was you in fold?

DONALD TRUMP: I would never negotiate --

CHRIS MATTHEWS: What WOULD you do?

DONALD TRUMP: I would -- what I'd really like to do --

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Would you try to stop it?

DONALD TRUMP: Yes, I would try and stop it.. I would do everything I could to redefine the area --

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Would you bomb?

DONALD TRUMP: I would bomb, I would do whatever I could to stop it. The one thing I would never do is pay ransom. Because once you pay ransom, it's over.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: You've paid tribute -- some of the Republican candidates have paid tribute saying that the minute he came in in 1981, they sent the hostages back. What was he threatening with implicitly? There must be something --

DONALD TRUMP: He said they will not be there when I'm president.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Well, they also --

(CROSSTALK)

DONALD TRUMP: -- and he meant it.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: They did that to punish Carter anyway.

DONALD TRUMP: No.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Where's this power? How do you use --

DONALD TRUMP: I think he was a little bit scared. I watched that. And Carter was a nice man, but you know, they had no fear of Carter for whatever reason. OK.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: How do you -- no, this is very important. I learned when I worked with Tip O'Neill in the old days that the reason that the Russians were impressed with Reagan is he broke the Paco strike. It was a demonstration. (INAUDIBLE) came back and said those guys are --

(CROSSTALK)

DONALD TRUMP: That was not an easy strike.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: How do you demonstrate strength so they don't take our hostages? How do you get the message across like Reagan did, don't mess with me? Because strength is a lot about the appearance of strength. How do you create that?

DONALD TRUMP: I think the strike in his case was good. But I think it's almost an air that some people have, not a lot of people --

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Do you have it?

DONALD TRUMP: Well, I don't ever want to be saying that I have it. I mean, you obviously think I do because I --

CHRIS MATTHEWS: No, I'm asking. I'm wondering how you can (INAUDIBLE)

DONALD TRUMP: I always hate when somebody says, I have this or I have that. I don't talk about myself. People can say whatever they want.

I'll tell you one thing. If we didn't get our hostages back -- we paid $150 billion for hostages. But if we didn't get them back or the 10 sailors the way they made us look, that was a pretty humbling thing, what they did with the 10 sailors. But if we didn't get our hostages back, they would have had hell to pay if I were president, that I can tell you.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Have you been impressed by any opponent in this campaign? Personally impressed? "Wow that guy --

DONALD TRUMP: Well, I wouldn't want to tell you yes. Yeah, a couple of them are impressive. Some of them are unimpressive. I mean, I think Jeb Bush to me is very unimpressive. Very unimpressive.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: I noticed. How about Kasich?

DONALD TRUMP: Yeah, he's got something that's OK. I mean, he's got something. He's done a good job. Now, he got help with fracking, in all fairness. When you frack --

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Do you know how many Democrats I bump into that like Kasich?

DONALD TRUMP: I like him!

CHRIS MATTHEWS: No, as a candidate.

DONALD TRUMP: No, I like him. I like him, too. He was very nice; then he went hostile on me. Kasich went very hostile in the second debate.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: I know, but you're the frontrunner. He's king of the hill. You know how that works. Do you think he would be a good running mate for you?

DONALD TRUMP: I think he would. I'm not thinking running mates now --

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Ohio. Ohio.

DONALD TRUMP: Well, I have very good poll numbers in Ohio.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: You got to win Ohio.

DONALD TRUMP: You have to win Ohio, you have to be at Florida.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: How do you get Florida?

DONALD TRUMP: Well, right now, I'm at 48 percent in Florida. I'm at 48, Bush is at like 6, and Rubio, I think, is at 11. And I'm at 48. And I'm saying, what do I need anybody for, right?

CHRIS MATTHEWS: OK, tomorrow night if you win, you're the frontrunner. Are you going to let anybody take it away from you and say, well, he didn't beat the spread.

(CROSSTALK)

The bronze winner -- I'm sorry, the silver winner tomorrow will be the real winner.

DONALD TRUMP: Well, that happened a little bit in Iowa. I came in second. I was 2,400 votes ahead of the third place. And the third place person, who is Marco, was like a genius king. I never even did it before. This is the first time I ever ran for office.

So, I came in second -- probably came in first, to be honest with you -- because folks were taken away from Carson that if they weren't taken away, I would have come in first. So, let's say I came in first or second because I don't forget things like that. And all of a sudden the guy that came in third is like a hero, and the guy that came in second -- and I kept saying how come he's a hero and --

CHRIS MATTHEWS: OK, got one big problem. Rubio proved the other day he repeats himself.

DONALD TRUMP: That's not good.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: So he'll repeat himself in this regard. He will say, I won again. They guy's --

DONALD TRUMP: How big of an impact does it have long term. Short term it has an impact. Will that affect him long term?

CHRIS MATTHEWS: OK, let's talk about -- I think you and Bernie have two things in common. He's a socialist, self-described -- I'm not knocking. That's what he wants to be. And you're a nationalist. I believe that about you. You both have a focus, and you both have joy in your campaign. There's fun when people leave your things.

(CROSSTALK)

You seem to have lost some joy since Iowa.

DONALD TRUMP: Lost or gained?

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Lost. You don't seem as happy as you were last week.

DONALD TRUMP: Really? I think I'm happier now. With those polls -- you just showed me those polls. That makes me very happy.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Oh, well, that's why I'm here.

DONALD TRUMP: I'll tell you, we have another thing in common with Bernie. There's only one difference. I can do something about trade. He knows the United States is getting ripped off by China, by Japan, by Mexico, by everybody. OK? And so do I.

The difference is I'm going to do something about it. We're going to make a fortune. Bernie can't do anything about it. He wouldn't know where to begin.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: How do you make China change its currency policies?

DONALD TRUMP: By telling them that if you don't change, you're going to have a hard time trading with us.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: And what do we do about our debt problem with China if we stop trading with them?

DONALD TRUMP: We work out a deal with them.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: See, they got -- don't they have us by the shorts?

DONALD TRUMP: No, we have them.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Because they have our paper!

DONALD TRUMP: Excuse me. We have them. They need our money to come in. Chris, we have them, and nobody's --

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Who's carrying our debt?!

DONALD TRUMP: It doesn't make any difference.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: We're up to $20 trillion, and they're carrying us.

DONALD TRUMP: Chris, if we played numbers with them with trade, they would have a depression the likes of which you've never seen before.

We have China. We're going to make a great deal with China. Don't forget, I have the biggest bank in the world from China in my building. I sell millions, tens of millions of dollars worth of condos. I own the Bank of America building in San Francisco because of China along with a group.

I want to tell you something: we have all the cards. And I deal with China, and I love -- I have nothing against China. What I have -- no, no, what I'm upset about is that our leaders deal so badly.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: All right, late breaking news, last question. The counter on the former president of Mexico president says he won't pay for the wall. What's it mean to you?

DONALD TRUMP: OK. He'll pay. Trust me, he'll pay. We have such a trade imbalance with Mexico, we have such a trade deficit, the wall is peanuts compared to anything else.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Would you get rid of NAFTA?

DONALD TRUMP: I would get rid of it or amend it greatly. NAFTA has been a disaster, especially for New Hampshire and areas like this.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Thank you.

DONALD TRUMP: Thank you.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Donald Trump, thanks for coming over. Coming up -- well, the presidential candidate and New Hampshire (INAUDIBLE) frontrunner, Donald Trump. Thank you.

(APPLAUSE)

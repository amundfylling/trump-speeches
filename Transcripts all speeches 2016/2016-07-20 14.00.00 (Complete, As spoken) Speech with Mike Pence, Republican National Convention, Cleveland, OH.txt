DONALD TRUMP: Thank you, everybody. This is really an honor.

And we're going to win Ohio, right?

(APPLAUSE)

Come here, Mike. We're going to win Ohio, we're going to win it all. We're going to make America great again, that's what we want to do.

But the last time I got accused of speaking a little bit long, so this time, we're going to speak a lot short. But I just want to introduce a man who has become a friend of mine, somebody who is going to make an unbelievable vice president of the United States, Governor Mike Pence.

(APPLAUSE)

MIKE PENCE: Let's hear it for the next president of the United States of America, Donald Trump.

(APPLAUSE)

It is such an honor to join your family to welcome you to Cleveland. We're excited to hear you address the nation tomorrow night. It has been exciting to hear from your family -- more to come tonight. And I'm convinced what begins in Cleveland will end in the White House.

(APPLAUSE)

Thank you, and God bless you. And welcome to Cleveland.

DONALD TRUMP: Thank you very much, Mike. I just want to also congratulate Don, and Tiffany and Eric is going to have his shot tonight, and Eric is going to be great. And Ivanka tomorrow night. And my whole family.

And Karen, I want to just -- and your whole family is an incredible family, and we love having you with us in this endeavor. And hopefully, we're going to do an amazing job, and an amazing job for the country, most importantly. So, thank you very much.

And kids, congratulations. Fantastic job. Thank you very much.

Thank you. Thank you everybody. We'll go and start working.

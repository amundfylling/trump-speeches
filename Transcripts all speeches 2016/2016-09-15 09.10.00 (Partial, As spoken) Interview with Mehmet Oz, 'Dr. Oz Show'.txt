MEHMET OZ: How do you stay healthy on the campaign trail?

DONALD TRUMP: Well, it's a lot of work. You know, when I'm speaking in front of 15,000 and 20,000 people and I'm up there using a lot of motion, I guess, in its own way, it's a -- it's a pretty healthy act and I really enjoy doing it. A lot of times, these rooms are very hot like saunas. And I guess that's a form of exercise, and, you know.

MEHMET OZ: So everyone's talking about the candidates' medical records.

DONALD TRUMP: Right.

MEHMET OZ: So I'd like to clear up some questions that folks weren't asking about your health. Is that OK?

DONALD TRUMP: OK.

MEHMET OZ: Now, I'm hoping to go with these exact same questions with Secretary Clinton. Now, see, as a doctor, when I have someone in front of me and I don't know much about them, I do something called the review of systems. We all do, we learn this in medical school. And it's a checklist, head to toe, of what's going on in your body.

DONALD TRUMP: OK.

MEHMET OZ: I'll walk through these questions, if it's OK. We start with the head. So have you ever had a neck issues?

DONALD TRUMP: No.

MEHMET OZ: Neurologic problems? Strokes, headaches?

DONALD TRUMP: No.

MEHMET OZ: Any problems with --

DONALD TRUMP: Do we have water around here? Here.

MEHMET OZ: Oh, water. Water, OK.

DONALD TRUMP: OK. No, the answer is no. We've had -- I've had -- I mean, no, no problem.

MEHMET OZ: Hormone problems, like thyroid issues?

DONALD TRUMP: No.

MEHMET OZ: Blood sugar problems? Diabetes?

DONALD TRUMP: Nope.

MEHMET OZ: Any heart problems?

DONALD TRUMP: No.

MEHMET OZ: I know you're on Lipitor, or some type of statin drug.

DONALD TRUMP: Yes. I do take -- I take a statin.

MEHMET OZ: Right.

DONALD TRUMP: I don't know if I should mention the name. I would, but --

MEHMET OZ: You don't have to.

DONALD TRUMP: I take a statin. And, actually, I've experimented with three statins and one seems for me to work the best. And it's really brought my cholesterol down into a good range.

MEHMET OZ: How long have you been on it?

DONALD TRUMP: A couple of years, I would say. A couple of years.

MEHMET OZ: Lung complaints, asthma, wheezing?

DONALD TRUMP: No, nothing -- I mean, really nothing. It's been -- people are amazed because I don't get much with the colds. Sometimes in the spring or in the fall, I'll get a little hay fever and that comes and goes. Actually, I don't know why this would be. It used to be worse when I was young. Maybe it's given up on me.

MEHMET OZ: Yes.

DONALD TRUMP: But when I was young, it was -- it could be pretty, you know, pretty rough, the hay fever. But very, very little now. And I don't know if that's something that you're not that surprised at, but the hay fever is not very big. But that would be about the only thing. I don't -- I haven't had a cold in a long time, years.

MEHMET OZ: Stomach problems, intestine issues, reflux, diverticulitis?

DONALD TRUMP: No.

MEHMET OZ: Bladder or prostate issues? I saw the one letter that was released had a low PSA figure.

DONALD TRUMP: Yes, my PSA's been very good. I've been -- I don't know what's going on, but so many of my friends are having problems where they're getting the operation or they're going for radiation. And it's always the first number I ask for. I said give me that number, I want to know. And my number's been, as you said, a very good number. It's been very, very good.

MEHMET OZ: Any history of personal cancer?

DONALD TRUMP: No, none so far.

MEHMET OZ: Skin issues?

DONALD TRUMP: No, very little. I mean, probably, you could say, you -- I try and stay out of the sun for the most part. I wear a hat. I play golf and I wear a hat, but I've had no problem. No major problem but certainly no problem with skin.

MEHMET OZ: Blood clots or any other blood problems?

DONALD TRUMP: No, no.

MEHMET OZ: Let me turn to the family history --

DONALD TRUMP: I have to be very boring for you. Really, it's --

MEHMET OZ: No, no. I'm --

DONALD TRUMP: It's got to be very boring.

MEHMET OZ: This is what I do as a doctor.

DONALD TRUMP: I would tell you -- I would tell you, you know, my wife's a big fan of your show, and I would absolutely say because I view this as, in a way, going to see my doctor. Just a little bit public, that's all.

DONALD TRUMP: Thank you. That's so beautiful. Thank you.

(APPLAUSE) Thank you, folks. That's so nice. I -- I have to tell you -- I have to thank Fred "The Hammer." You know, he wouldn't be allowed to play in the NFL today. He hits too hard, OK? You know?

(LAUGHTER)

See, we're all getting softer, you understand, and our country's getting softer. But I'll tell you what, that was the -- that was the good old days. So Fred -- get over here for a second, Fred. Come here. That was so nice. I love people that hit hard. We need people that hit hard. Come here.

(APPLAUSE)

He was a hitter. He was a hitter. You know, after one or two hits, they sort of said, "I don't want to catch the ball anymore, " right?

(LAUGHTER)

And a really amazing guy, somebody that Bobby Knight has so much respect for. He said, "You play this guys, it's brutal always. It was always tough."

Coach Keady, come on out. Come here.

(APPLAUSE)

Coach, come on over.

(APPLAUSE)

What a great man and a great family. I just met his wife, and she's incredible. We've had so much support.

So I just got a call, Lou Holtz just endorsed us. So Lou, Lou is another one.

(APPLAUSE)

What incredible -- what incredible people, such spirit. And you know, I love that you people -- but sit down. We'll stay for each other for a long time. Sit down.

You know, it's so nice. So often, I'll say, "Sit down, " they just refuse. You're going to sit down. This is a beautiful place, by the way. This is nice. It's nice.

(APPLAUSE)

Now, we've had this response all over. No matter where we go on (SIC) the country, we go to Dallas, we go to Alabama, we had 35,000 in Alabama. The other night, we had 31,000 in Los Angeles near the Los Angeles area. We were all over. And I'll tell you -- and they were burning the American flag, OK? You tell me, OK? Not inside. Inside it was a love fest. We had 31,000 people. It was incredible. But outside, they burned the American flag and they held up other flags from other countries, and I want to tell you, that's not we're about, you know?

We're going to take good care of everyone, but it's America First now, folks. It's America First. Just remember that. Just remember that.

(APPLAUSE)

You know, I watch television. There was a group of people. I don't even know them because I'm doing another one of these at seven. I've been doing them all. But I love doing them. A friend of mine, very, very successful -- I love doing them.

But a friend of mine, a very, very successful guy came with me to one. I had 24,000, 25,000 in Tampa, Florida. And he said, how do you that? Get before these people. I said, you know, honestly -- this guy's a really successful guy, great guy.

And not because he's successful, he's great. He's one of the few. He's rich but he's a nice guy. Most of the rich aren't so nice, but that's OK.

(LAUGHTER)

But we still want them negotiating our trade deals for us, not these political hacks. Believe me.

(APPLAUSE)

So, he said, how do you that with so many people? I said, you know, honestly, you get before them and its like we're all in love. We're like -- we're just going to straighten out this country. We love our country. We love each other. And our rallies are the safest place you can be on Earth. You don't read that, you don't hear that.

But our rallies are safe and beautiful. And there's love in the room. And it's so easy to speak when you have that kind of love in the room. And that kind, whether I'm in a place like this or in arena, no matter where you are, we want to make America great again.

And I said to him, it's so easy to speak. It really is. He still didn't believe me. But believe me, it is. OK. So, I appreciate you all being here. And I really appreciate -- thank you.

(APPLAUSE)

I really appreciate Indiana. But there was a tremendous line and they started assembling it. And it was on Fox and it was on all of them, CNN. But it was a huge line and I'm not sure. It might be for the 7 o'clock speech.

But it was just this tremendous line. And they met a few young guys that were definitely was like Cruz. Cruz was like -- you know, this guy is a liar. That's why we call him Lyin' Ted. We call him Lyin' Ted.

(APPLAUSE)

I never saw -- did you know that Donald Trump wants to raise your taxes by 40 percent? And the guy said, no he doesn't. Did you know that he is in favor in Obamacare? No, he's not. But I mean -- and when he said it, he meant it, this guy. This guy knew.

And it was very -- you know, he actually said, how's your loan doing at Goldman Sachs. That was, I thought, the coolest. Now, is that guy here with the sunglasses? I don't know if he's here or seven. But whoever he is, I thought he was very cool. I thought him and his friends.

Because, they're not going to be buffaloed by lies.

(APPLAUSE)

By lies. You know, I wrote down some of the things this guy was saying on Cruz. And it's just unbelievable that I was going to raise taxes. I have the biggest tax cut of anybody running for office by far. And in fact, if there was one criticism of my tax plan and policy, it was that I lowered taxes too much, OK?

And he said -- it's true. I was the one the Wall Street Journal said, we can't afford that much of a tax decrease. And I have Cruz saying, he's going to raise your taxes 40 percent. It's unbelievable. Lyin' Ted. It's unbelievable.

He made a statement that Donald Trump doesn't intend to build a wall. Believe me folks, we're building the wall. Believe me. We're building the wall.

(APPLAUSE)

No, we're building the wall. We have no choice? Do we have a choice? We have to...

AUDIENCE: Build the wall!

DONALD TRUMP: The loyalty to all of us. You know, I'm sort of just -- I consider myself a messenger. I'm a good messenger. I mean, I've been doing this for nine months. These other guys have been doing it for 35 years we're -- boom, boom boom. We're knocking them out like corn flakes, right? But honestly the whole thing -- it's a movement that's going on and it's -- I call it a movement to competence because a lot of it's common sense.

It's like getting into a great school. Often if you like apply to Harvard or you apply to the Wharton School of Finance or to apply to Stanford or you apply -- it's really hard to get in but once you're there it's OK. It's sort of like much easier.

It's hard here to do what we're doing but we have a mission all together and we're going to (INAUDIBLE) -- we're not going to make deals like they made with Iran where we're giving $150 billion. We get absolutely nothing and now on top of everything -- I've been saying it for a long time. You see what's happening in Iraq. It's imploding. Iran goes in, takes it over. They won't have to fire a shot and they've been trying to do for decades and decades and decades.

And you won't have to fire a shot. We handed it to them. Should have never been there. Should have never got out the way the way Obama got that. How about that? It takes everybody immediately and announces the date. Now the enemy said, "ah, there's no way he's moving that date." Turned out he was right and that's why I say we have to be unpredictable especially militarily.

They'll ask me sometimes -- yeah.

(APPLAUSE)

We got to be -- we've got to be unpredictable. We've got to -- we are so totally predictable and it's so embarrassing. No matter what happens -- it's so embarrassing and what we're going to do is we're going to go out and we're going to make our country so great again and it's not going to be -- we're not going to be embarrassed anymore but what happens.

We're not going to be embarrassed that our ten sailors get captured, get treated like hostages, like prisoners and the only reason they gave them back -- now with me they would have given them back, OK? With me they would have not taken them. Believe me, they would not have taken them.

(APPLAUSE)

But the only reason we got them back is because in two days the money was supposed to start flowing into Iran. And you look at what's happening and you look at how sad it is and that we didn't get our prisoners -- the original four and there's actually another over there by the way that nobody even talks about. But that we didn't get our four prisoners back before we started negotiating years ago is a disgrace. We should never negotiate under circumstances like that. Never.

(APPLAUSE)

Never. So I marked down some of the things -- we have two people left. One is Kasich. He's a nice guy. Now they made this stupid deal -- anybody in business would not have made the deal and by the way since making the deal their numbers tanked. It was stupid. It was politicians making deals. They're politicians -- they're making deals.

(APPLAUSE)

How stupid is this deal and while I assume they didn't ink it I still say before the ink was dry it was violated by both parties, right? Politicians, this is what we have. These are the people that negotiate for us. These are the people that are giving us and giving away trillions and trillions of dollars. This is why we have deficits that are 19 trillion and it's going to be 21 trillion very, very soon with that really dumb omnibus budget. And you look at what happened with that. Then he picks Carly. Carly's perfectly nice.

By the way she fell off the stage the other day. Did anybody see that?

(LAUGHTER)

And Cruz didn't do anything. That was a -- even I would have helped her, OK? No, it's true. The weirdest thing.

They just showed it to me coming in. I said, "No, I didn't see it." They just showed it to me. And I said, "Wow, that's really cruel." She fell off -- she just went down. She went down a long way, right? And she went down right in front of him and he was talking, he kept talking. He didn't even look like -- that was a weird deal.

(LAUGHTER)

Man. And then they were both talking. She was talking from the back and he was talking from there. They were both talking. That's so weird. But that was unnecessary and it was a bad thing to do. And you know, I said he set a record. First candidate in the history of this country who has no path to victory who can't win and he picked a vice presidential candidate.

(APPLAUSE)

That's hard. And you've got to give her credit for accepting it. She said, "I'll accept it even though there's no chance of winning." I mean, that's...

(LAUGHTER)

It's a weird deal. But you know, you have so many different things and I love seeing all of those people in line, and they were there from six o'clock that -- Fox and CNN, they're all saying from six o'clock in the morning. All that big line, that big, huge line, thousands and thousands of people. And even here, there are thousands of people outside that wanted to get in. You people know real estate a little bit better. Congratulations. Look at the people in the front row. Pretty good, right?

(APPLAUSE)

Pretty good. Pretty good.

But I -- you know, I look and I look at the -- the difficulty of politics. I mean, you know, I've been doing this for a fairly short period of time. I've never seen lying and deception and all of the things like this. I've been in business, and they're no angels. And frankly, they're much tougher people. Business is tougher, but -- and again, they're not the greatest. You've good ones, you've got bad ones like everything else. But I've never seen lying and deception like you see in politics. It's terrible. It's terrible. It's truly terrible.

(APPLAUSE)

Where -- where somebody will go out and hear me and watch me and watch good ovations, and then say the exact opposite, "Trump is going to do this." Or "Trump will never build a wall, " or "Trump loves Obamacare." I mean, I always say -- how many people have heard this? We will repeal and replace Obamacare. Then I'm listening to (INAUDIBLE) repeal and replace it.

(APPLAUSE)

Right? And then I'm hearing Cruz -- then I'm hearing Cruz today, "Donald Trump loves Obamacare. He will keep it. He will this." It's so -- and I want to take that television and I want to smack it, but I can't. I can't. And I heard another good one. "I picked Carly Fiorina as our vice president. Donald Trump, on the other hand, will campaign with Mike Tyson."

(LAUGHTER)

It's true. Now, I don't know anything, but Mike was nice enough -- I don't know. I heard on the internet he endorsed me. He said, "I endorse Donald Trump." I will say, when you have guys like this, the coach and Fred and all of the people and Bobby Knight, such an incredible guy. What an incredible guy. What an incredible...

(APPLAUSE)

And so many people. I mean, I'm really proud when you think 16,500 border patrol agents, first time they've ever endorsed a presidential candidate, they endorse...

(APPLAUSE)

And Sheriff Joe and I mean, it's amazing. It's amazing. So many of the pastors and the ministers have endorsed us. It's -- it's been -- it's been just an incredible experience. For me, it's been an incredible -- it's been an incredible experience.

(APPLAUSE)

And great people. I mean, just great people. And I just -- I just want to say that, you know, having done this now and having been for a long time and having so many friends in Indiana and Bobby sort of said it better than anybody could say it. He said, "Trump's going to be a great president." See, I can't say that about myself, although I'll say it because that's what we want to hear. I mean, I'm going to bring it back and we're going to bring it back. But he said, "Trump's going to be a great president."

And honestly, if we win Indiana, it's over. It's over.

(APPLAUSE)

They're finished. They're gone. They're gone.

And if we don't, they'll win it next week, or the week after, or the week after. It's fine because they have no path -- was there ever an easy path? I mean, we'll win it in the first ballot. And when I look at these guys going around and talking to delegates, and buying them hot dogs, and hamburgers, and hotel rooms, or this or that, and they're all playing -- just so you understand, they're all playing for the second, third, fourth bat.

They're never going to get there. We are way over and way ahead of projection and we'll do it on the first ballot. But if we win Indiana, it's over.

(APPLAUSE)

So -- and Bobby said, "this way, Indiana can take the credit when Trump does a good job and I want to remember that, OK."

So I want to thank all of the folks and I want to thank Bobby, I'll tell you, he was something. We trekked around all over the place and he was amazing. And you ought to see the love in the room.

Coach Cady, same thing, he said, "Bobby was such a great guy." And Bobby has such a respect for the coach. But when Bobby came round and we went around from place to place, and people would stand up for five minutes and they just loved this guy. They want to win.

He won 900 games. Think of it, three championships, it's tough to win those championships, he won three. 900 games he won and you know, he won the Olympics, and he won the PanAm Games right?

And he had the last undefeated season in college basketball, I mean, and he almost had two. And he said, "Donald, if you mention the one before because the season before, I lost one game. Say that I screwed up, " meaning he screwed up. I said, "coach, I don't want to say, how could I -- what were you like 32 -1, and I'm going to say you screwed up?" "No, no, " he said, "I put in the wrong player, just tell them, they'll understand." I said, "I refuse to say it, " so I said, "he wants me to say that he screwed up." Wouldn't it be nice to have a coach that screwed and you're like 32-1 or something like that? Everybody wants that kind of a coach. So anywise, Bobby's been great, I wanted to just thank them.

I just thank everybody. It's been an incredible experience for me and I've learned a lot. I mean, I've learned a lot. And you know, one of the things I like to do before I go to an area, and by the way, even your governors have treated me very nicely. I have to tell you, he was under pressure. He was under a lot of pressure from his supporters and from people that put up money, from politicians in all fairness, and you know, the donors and special interest, and you're under pressure.

He said nicer things about me than he said about Cruz. It's true, right if you think about? And I like him, and I like him. But you know he said nicer things about me than Cruz. And the role of pundits said, " you know what, I think that was maybe the weakest endorsement in the history of endorsements, " it's true.

(APPLAUSE)

In fact at the end, they had one group had to rerun the tape just to find out who he was -- so it's sort of fun.

But they're under a lot of a pressure. You know, I'm self- funding my campaign so I don't have any pressure. I don't have pressure. I'm going to do what's right for you.

(APPLAUSE)

Cruz tells you about Wall Street, or the big bad bankers, and this and that, and all the stuff.

Now, he didn't put down on his personal financial disclosure form that he borrowed a million dollars from CitiBank and Goldman Sachs. He didn't say that. He left it off which you're not allowed to do. You know, that's a big violation. I don't know what's the recourse but it's a big violation.

But in fact, one of the guys mentioned this morning that -- you know, we're sort of debating on our front, what about Goldman Sachs? The guy knew what he was talking about. He left out the million dollars, didn't put it down on his personal financial disclosure form. And then he'll come and tell you about how he's going to protect you from the banks. Let me tell you, Goldman Sachs and CitiBank have him totally under the control folks, believe me. OK, he may talk but believe me, they have him 100 percent under control.

Me? I'm not taking money so it's very easy OK?

(APPLAUSE)

So what I like to do is -- and it's become very depressing, but don't be depressed, because we're going to turn it around. But it is. It's depressing. I asked my statisticians. I have people. They do nothing but stats, which can't be a very exciting job right?

(LAUGHTER)

I wouldn't want it. They love it. Me, I wouldn't want that job. But they're good at it. And they get it right from the books. And they said this area, which is a great area, great people, has lost one in four manufacturing jobs since 2001, the year Congress voted to put China into the World Trade Organization. Mistake.

The vote gave China permanent, most favored nation trading status. That gives them an advantage. Why? What are we doing? Why? And I do a lot of business with China. And I love China. China's fine. I made a lot of money with China.

They have the biggest bank in the world as my tenant in Manhattan, one of my building. Good tenant. Pays the rent on time.

(LAUGHTER)

This is a serious -- the bank has 400 million customers. That's a big bank. That's means that's Citibank -- I said to the head of the bank, how big are you compared to, let's say, Citibank? And they said, that is like a small subsidiary.

You know, it's like -- it's true. It's like a little bank by comparison. But it's my tenant. I have two big buildings, Bank of America building in San Francisco and 1290 Avenue, the Americas, it's one of the biggest buildings in New York, biggest floor place.

And I got that through China. Not friendly, unfriendly. It was a war. And it's turned out to be a great deal with a wonderful partner. And we ended up making a fantastic deal. And they buy condos like they are mashed potatoes from me.

(LAUGHTER)

You don't understand. It's like pancakes. I'll take one $10 billion. I'll take one for $9 billion. Nothing against China. And I'm not angry at China. I'm not angry at Mexico. And I'm not angry at India or Vietnam, which is hot as a pistol right now, taking a lot of stuff away from us.

I'm not angry at Japan. They send cars over by the million. We give them practically nothing. You talk about a trade unbalance. They're up here. We're down like below that stage. It's trade imbalance. I'm not angry at any of them.

I'm angry at our leaders for being grossly incompetent and not knowing -- right?

(APPLAUSE)

And not knowing what they're doing, because there's no reason for it.

(AUDIO GAP)

So a few more things, Indiana has lost 5,000 jobs over the last period of time, manufacturing jobs. In the last three months, you lost 5,000 jobs? That's not good, OK? According -- last three months, you lost 5,000 jobs.

Somebody else says, oh you're doing well. Great. According to the Federal Reserve, real median household income in the state of Indiana has declined $10,000 since 1999. That means you're working harder and you're making less.

Some of you have two jobs. I understand it. You know, nobody else understood it. They're all trying to say, what's going on with Trump? I understand it. I grew up -- you know, my father was a builder in Brooklyn and Queens and I would work on jobs.

And I get to know people. People say, why do you relate so well to like, carpenters and electricians? And I mean, I grew up with them. I know them better. Frankly, I don't like the rich people so much if you want to know the truth.

(LAUGHTER)

Those are the ones I don't like as much. Not nearly as much. But look at this. This area lost about 15 percent of its construction jobs since The Recession. The city of Indianapolis has lost one third of its manufacturing jobs since 1990.

Carrier Air Condition (SIC) -- now I've been dealing in Carrier since it announced and I guess a lot of you have heard because unfortunately -- look at all the cameras back there. They always put my speeches on live television which is a big disadvantage because I have to come up with a new speech every four hours, right? You can't say -- it's true.

(APPLAUSE)

It's true. Otherwise they'll say he's a very repetitive person. Well, they only do it because of the ratings but I do, I have to change it up. These other guys, they walk around, they read the exact same speech at every single stop, right? Every single stop they read a speech and it's always within 30 seconds of length and then they walk out.

People fall asleep. Everyone's sleeping, everyone goes home. Nobody votes for them, they're out of the race. Me, I don't have any teleprompters. I'm up here all by myself, OK? I'm up here all by myself.

(APPLAUSE)

Even for victory speeches I saw the other night Hillary Clinton -- she's got a teleprompter and we will travel north and south and east and west. And I would say that she started screaming at the teleprompter but I'm not allowed to say that.

You know why? Now if she was a man I could say it but as a woman ladies I'm sorry I'm not allowed say it. She was screaming at the teleprompter but I will not say it, OK?

(APPLAUSE)

Many women tell me it's terrible what she's doing and a poll just came out one hour ago. The Rasmussen poll where Trump is leading Hillary Clinton, OK? Leading. Trump is leading.

(APPLAUSE)

We're going to win. We're going to win. No, I watch this Cruz guy. I am the only who can win this race. He sounds like Shakespeare, right? This is like, everything's always Shakespeare even if he's making a simple statement.

I am the only one -- I always kid but I'm not -- unfortunately I'm telling the truth. He walks up with a bible held high, right? Held high, the bible, boom. Then he comes over and he starts lying like nobody I've ever seen.

(LAUGHTER)

But he's -- and by the way and also another poll, the Wall Street Journal came out just now, Trump in Indiana which is what we care about although we do love their national poll I have to say.

(LAUGHTER)

In order words, winning in Indiana without the rest of it none of us are too happy. But in Indiana Trump is over Hillary 48 to 41.

(APPLAUSE)

But Kasich who has not had one negative ad and he's a nice guy. I don't like his eating habits to be totally honest,

(LAUGHTER)

In fact, I was eating at a good restaurant today in Indianapolis. A nice -- really nice place and the owner was great and they were serving food. I said -- turned off all the cameras -- camera...

(LAUGHTER)

I don't want any -- but it's true. I always tell my son, little tiny bites. I tell all my kids -- Ivanka, Don, Eric, Tiffany -- all as they were growing up -- little, little bites and I see him...

(LAUGHTER)

I don't get it and I've never seen a man make so many news conferences while he's eating. He's always eating. He's never standing up having a news conference so when I sat down I just said, "do me a favor, get those cameras away. I don't want to be " -- they'll say I'm copying him. I don't want that. But his standard line -- and Cruz more than any -- he said, "I am the only one that beat Hillary Clinton." He's going to get killed. Killed.

(LAUGHTER)

So, he has that negative ad and Kasich hasn't had one negative ad because nobody cares, you know? There's no -- listen to this. So I was saying 55,000 as of a week ago. Well, it's changed. I've had 60,000 -- hard to believe. Although, if it were me, you'd believe it because I -- every time I see one, and it's all the time.

I was in Florida and I'm telling you, I won Florida in a landslide. But I tell my people there's no way I can win. I tell my people the day before the election there is no way I can win because I was there, I own Doral and we had this major golf tournament. You know, world championship. Cadillac world championship. Adam Scott won.

And I'm there and I'm telling you, I said to my people, "It's going to be embarrassing. I mean, there's no way I can win." Every single ad in Florida for weeks was a negative ad on me, and they were false ads. Well, 90 percent, 95 percent.

(LAUGHTER)

Maybe even 95. But they were false ads. So many -- so much lies and deception. False. But they were one after another after another, four or five ads in a row, and my people said, "Mr. Trump, congratulations. You're going to win in a landslide." I said, "How can I win? I've got all these negative ads." I said, "I'm telling you, I'm not going to win." That's my own insecurity coming out, OK?

But I said, "I'm not going to win, " and we won by like more than 20 points. We won in a landslide, you know? Won in a landslide.

(APPLAUSE)

And then last night, I'm here and I'm watching television, I see all these phony ads. One after another after another. You know, "Stop Trump, " or "Never Trump, " or whatever the hell they call it.

(LAUGHTER)

And they -- they form the alliance in order to -- Never Trump -- because you know what? Because the people putting up the money own companies and they do business with China and they do business with Mexico and they want to keep it the way it is, folks. But we're getting killed in these deals, OK? So they're putting up all this money. One guy put up $3 million. One guy owns the Chicago Cubs. I'm rooting against that team now. They -- no, no. Think of it.

(LAUGHTER)

This guy, Ricketts or something, you know, I never met him. He owns the Chicago Cubs, he's putting up millions. I don't even know the guy. Can you imagine how badly I'd do if he knew me? I'd do even worse I guess. I don't even know him. I never -- I have no idea who he is. I still like them, they're a nice team. OK.

But you know what? He's putting up millions. Like somebody said, $3 million, $4 million, I said, "$3 million, $4 million, for what?" I'll do a better job than anybody else. Why are they doing this? The only reason is people have interests that you'll never know about and they do bet against the country, and they don't mind when the country loses its jobs. They don't mind when Carrier leaves 1,400 people go that are great people, moves to Mexico, makes air conditioners, sells them across the border, no tax, no thing, makes more money, OK?

And the air conditioners aren't going to sell for more money. They're going to sell for the same price because they have to compete with Trane. I buy a lot of air conditioners. Boy, do I buy -- I buy televisions and air conditioners, I buy a lot. But they've got to keep it competitive. All it is is they're going to make more money. They're going to let go of 1,400 people.

Now, here's the difference with me. You know, for years, you've been reading where the federal government is trying to stop the tremendous onslaught of companies that are leaving our country, and that means jobs, folks. It means huge money and it means jobs. So they say, "Well, we'll give them low interest loans." They don't need loans, they've got a lot of money. We'll give them other things. We'll give them all sorts of -- they don't need incentives. They don't incentives.

Let's give them a real incentive. Every single time they make an air conditioning unit in Mexico and send it across our now very strong border, they'll pay a 35 percent tax. That's all. That's all. That's all.

(APPLAUSE)

And you know what? They'll still make money. But one of two things will happen. Either our country's going to make a hell of a lot of money because they're going to still sell them -- because it may be too late. You know, maybe they've started their plant, it's probably never too late. We'll get them to come back.

You know, if we charge them -- they're still coming back. And I tell this to the politicians, "we like free market." Free market is great, I'm a free market guy but not when you're getting killed. We're getting killed.

I mean, look at your numbers, your numbers -- you're doing better than a lot of states, not a lot better. It actually surprised me when I look at some of these numbers, about Indianapolis, it's lost practically half of their jobs -- their manufacturing jobs.

Steel, look at steel, it's been wiped. Your coal industry is wiped. And here China is taking our coal. So China, and I'm going to open up clean coal. OK, we're going to open up our coal industry and we have miners that are incredible people.

(APPLAUSE)

I mean, we have this President that flies to Hawaii in a 747 with a big old engine, spewing stuff in the air, and he plays golf for two and half or three weeks. Then he gets on the 747 -- scroll there for us -- when he comes back, and he has a speech on the carbon footprint. Give me a break. Give me a break.

And in the meantime, our miners and our steel workers are being laid off all over the place. OK, not going to happen anymore folks. OK, it's going to happen anymore.

(APPLAUSE)

Not going to happen.

So the numbers -- I love you too. Where was that? Who was that person? Stand up. Great first lady, thank you. That is very nice. Thank you.

So it's not going to happen anymore. We're going to be the smart people now. We're going to be the smart people.

We can't continue to allow every nation in the world to think of us as fools. And you know, the funny thing, they're going to like us better when we get smart. They don't even like us.

Look at China, we have rebuilt China. They have taken so much money out of our country, they have rebuilt. When you have a trade -- look at the trade deficit with China, $500 billion a year, a year. $500 billion OK? Now, negotiated by fools, I mean, maybe they have a conflict of interest, I don't know, in which case they'd be dishonest, not fools. OK, that would be even worse.

It was negotiated by hacks, political hacks. I've got the greatest business people in the world. They're going to go and make unbelievable deals for us. We are going to turn it around. We are going to take jobs back. And you know, what's to happen, China is going to have more respect for us. They have no respect for us. They think we're a bunch of dummies.

Now, I've negotiated a lot with China as I've told you. And they come in waves. They don't come with one person, they come with 20 people and every one of them has an 180 IQ. And if one makes mistakes, another one, another one, they have like it's a catch basin. And we'll have some dope sitting there negotiating, and then we wonder why, why we're doing to badly.

I've got people that are better than anybody. They're the best in the world. They're very rich people, they don't want money, they don't want anything, they want to play the chess game. You know, they like it and they want to play the game.

And you know, those deals are bigger than any corporate deal. A deal like that, trade with China, you can take all your steel companies, everything else, and put them together, it's like a peanut compared to it. These people would love to do it and they want to do it for their ego. They actually love the country. Some of these guys are you know, not the nicest people and some are fantastic people.

Carl Icahn endorsed me, great business man. Other people endorsed me, great business people. And we want to give it to our best and I know the best negotiators. I know guys that are overrated. I know people that are underrated that you've never heard of that are better than anybody. We're going to have great, great business people. So think of China, they've stripped our country and you know, we owe them $1.8 trillion, right? Does anybody know that? We owe them -- on top of -- so they take our jobs. They take our money. And we owe them $1.8 trillion. That's like a magic act in reverse.

(LAUGHTER)

I want some of the magic act. But we have to turn it around. China has no respect for us. We give them state dinner. Their leaders come in. We give them state dinners at the White House. And I said, don't do that. Let them come in to negotiate? What are you doing?

I actually jokingly said, let us take them to a McDonald's we'll have McDonald's and we'll get back to negotiations. Seriously. What are we doing?

(LAUGHTER)

We're honoring people and again I get along great with China. I love -- they're all great. I'm just so angry at our leaders for being so incompetent for being so stupid. OK. For being so stupid.

(APPLAUSE)

So we have rebuilt China. And they have done it to Europe in a much smaller way. But, we have rebuilt China. And bridges and tunnels and -- you've never seen anything like it. You go to China, they have highways like you have never seen. You see airports.

And also, you look at other places. You look at places in the Middle East. You look at places that you have never seen anything like what's going on. We're like a third-world country. And we're the ones that should be at the top. And we're at the bottom.

Our educational system is no good. Out of 30 countries, we're ranked 30th. You have Sweden, you have Norway, you have Denmark, you have China, you have Japan. You have other countries that are all in the top five and ten. We're number 30. And yet, we spend more per pupil than any other country by so much, that there is no second place.

It's so far behind us, and yet we're 30. Because we have this Common Core. It's a disaster. But it's even beyond that. We're going to get rid of Common Core, bring it local in all of them.

(APPLAUSE)

You know, I always say that I spent less money on the campaign than any other candidate, any other, certainly major candidate. But I spent far less money. Although I'm in for like $40 million bucks. It's not peanuts. It's still a lot of money, right?

But you've got to see these guys. I mean, Jeb Bush had a thing like $168 million. He's been out of here for months right? He's got nothing. And I wouldn't bring up his name. He said -- he was nasty the other day. They interviewed him.

What do you think of Trump? Well, he did call me a phenomena. That was the only good thing. Other than that, it wasn't so good. I said, what's he saying bad about me? He's out of the race, he should be saying positive.

Well, I wouldn't bring him up. But when they say bad about me -- you know, don't we agree? They said bad about me, I say bad about them. Who the hell cares?

(APPLAUSE)

But he said nasty things. He said he is not a true conservative. Who cares? We want to straighten out our country, you know? He's too conservative. What's the true conservative?

(APPLAUSE)

He is not a true conservative. He's always said that. He is not a true conservative. And I say, folks, first of all, I am a conservative. But they wouldn't say I'm conservative on trade, because a conservative is supposed to want free trade.

It doesn't matter how badly you get ripped off. It doesn't matter that this country is losing all of its jobs, all of its money. We're third-world status. It doesn't make any difference. National review. We will stay true to the core.

And we will let other countries continue to rip us off, because we want to remain a true conservative. And we want free trade. But I like free trade too. But the problem is we don't have people who are smart negotiating our deals, OK?

So, therefore, we can't do that right now. I'm sorry. Maybe there will be a time when we can go back to free trade. But you can't have free trade when China and others -- but China is the biggest abuser. China is a world-class grand master chess player and they are playing against checker players that are not good at it. That's our people. They're world-class grand masters.

They devalue their currency. Every time they devalue I just see dollar signs pouring out of the country. They're not supposed to be doing that but Obama doesn't know what's happening and he's too busy doing other things including playing golf and whatever and he allows it to happen.

About six months ago I'll never forget I said well, they'll never be able to devalue again. That was two years ago and they did the greatest devaluation in the last 20 years -- six months ago, five months ago and a massive devaluation. Which meant let's take more money out of the United States. We're going to take more -- our economy's going a little bit bad, let's take more money out of the United States and we let them get away with it.

We can't let that happen. Just remember -- just remember they're taking that money from us mostly. They're taking it out of our country, they're taking it out of our hide, they're taking it out of our jobs. We're losing everything so we have to fight back.

Now, am I a free trader? Absolutely. Will I allow our country to be ripped off for years and years to come because I want to say I'm a free trader? Absolutely not, folks. Absolutely not. I won't do it.

(APPLAUSE)

And once they hear -- a week ago I get a letter from high official at China and it was called in that Wall Street Journal -- somebody called me and they wanted a response to the letter. And it was a letter of protest that do not like the rhetoric of Donald Trump. I was so happy because they've never complained before.

(APPLAUSE)

They've never complained before and they wanted a response and my response was yes, here's my response. Tell whoever wrote the letter that the minister of finance -- one of the top people in China wrote a letter.

Sort of a letter of protest -- was angry that our partnership with the United States -- partnership -- I don't want that partnership. I want a partnership that works. Not a partnership where we're getting ripped for $505 billion to be exact, right? Our partnership with the United States is in jeopardy. Well, maybe we're better off not having that partnership. That's another way you could look at it, OK?

(APPLAUSE)

So -- and these eggheads that you watch on television -- and believe me I'm much smarter than they are, OK? Just so you understand. They call them the elite -- the elite. I have a nicer apartment then they do. I have a nicer plane than they do. They're elite. Why are they elite? We're elite, folks. We're elite. We're all elite, OK? They're not elite.

(APPLAUSE)

They always talk about the elite, the elite. Half of them -- I won't go into it but very dishonest people. And some are true believers and really -- some are true believers and they're wrong. They're wrong. We can't afford it anymore and I tell the -- last couple of times I told the story about a friend of mine.

He's unbelievable. He's dying. He was supposed to have died a year ago. He's just a physically and mentally very strong person and he's a really good guy. Tough guy, though. Really tough and he was supposed to have died a year ago. And he keeps hanging on and I call and every day the doctor told me a year ago. Good doctor -- says, "Mr. Trump, he won't be around for another month if he's lucky."

That's too bad and he's still living. That was a year ago and I say -- I sort of equate it to our country. And I call him and I say, "how you doing?" And he said, "I'm OK. I'm doing good. Feel better."

I say, "It's amazing. I love you. You're so incredible. You're tough, man. I love tough." Coach is tough, Bobby Knight is tough, Fred is tough. People are tough and they're good. It's -- we need toughness. We need a certain toughness, right? We need a toughness.

But it a certain way I equate it to our country because our country is like -- we've been abused for years and years and years. We're been losing to China for years. We've been losing to Japan with the cars. They send in millions of cars. We send them wheat. We send them nothing, practically. The trade imbalance is massive.

I -- I look at what's going on and I sort of equate our country to that. We just keep hanging on, hanging on. But in the meantime, you people are making less money. We just said it. You're making less money than you were making 20 years ago, 18 years ago to be exact. Probably 20 -- probably 25 -- and working harder.

But I related him all of a sudden to the country, how strong, how incredible our country is. To be in a position that we can afford to be abuse by everybody in the world like that and we're still here. It's incredible. How great will we be when we get it straightened out? And they're going to -- they're going to be fine. They're going to be fine with it.

(APPLAUSE)

So China is our number one abuser and -- and I don't blame them, because they can get away with it, but China is our number one abuser. But what are they doing? They're building a massive military fortress in the middle of the South China Sea, right? They're not supposed to be doing that. They're not supposed to be doing that. Why are they doing that? They have no respect for our president, they have no respect for our country. They're not supposed to be doing that.

Now, should we retaliate? The way we retaliate is economically, I don't think we want to start, you know, doing anything for that. And then you also say well, it affects Japan, it affects other countries. And we defend Japan and I like Japan. I like the people of Japan. I have a lot of friend sin Japan. But we defend Japan. We defend South Korea. We defend Germany. A lot of people didn't know this. I don't -- do you know we defend Germany? Do you know that we're defending Germany? We are defending Germany, we're defending Japan.

Japan wanted to beat the hell out of China many years ago, right? Japan went in and did a big number on Korea. I mean, we're defending -- we are defending Japan, and that's OK because why should we let the, start building up? But you know what we're losing on these deals? We are defending the world. We're defending Germany, Japan, South Korea. South Korea's a monster economically. You want a television? It's South Korea. You want air conditioning -- you want anything, you've got to order -- the biggest ships are made in South Korea.

We defend them. We have 28,000 soldiers on the border, right, 28,000 between North and South -- the maniac. I call him the maniac. We've got to do something about that. And by the way, China can do it with a phone call, OK? They can do it with a phone call. All we have to do is say, "Got to do it. Go to do it, folks. You better do it." This guy's playing with nuclears. Our biggest problem.

You know, Obama thinks our biggest problem is global warming, can you believe this? No, it's true. I heard it and I said, "No, no. That's a joke. Who told that joke? That sounds very -- was that Jimmy Fallon?"

(LAUGHTER)

Was that Jimmy Kimmel? Who told that joke? That's very -- no, no. That's not a joke. And then I went and he really meant it. Our biggest problems is global warming of the nuclear variety, and we better be damn careful.

(APPLAUSE)

We better be damn careful. We better be very, very careful.

So you look at what's going on and we defend all these people. We defend Saudi Arabia. Now, until the oil went down -- they're still making a fortune -- but until the oil went down, they were making $1 billion a day, $1 billion a day. We defend them.

And we have military bases where we pay the rent. We pay rent, OK? Think of it. We pay rent. They probably negotiate, "We'll give you a good deal. Pay us " -- what? "Pay us." We're paying rent. What's going on? How stupid -- how stupid are these people? How stupid?

$1 billion a day and I have many friends in Saudi Arabia. They're good people. Talk about people buying apartments, I mean, seriously, they got so much money they don't know what to do. They make my plane look small. I'm very embarrassed.

They wouldn't be there honestly for two weeks if we didn't defend them. If you look at what's going over with Iran, Iran is now taking over Iraq. Look at the rioting in Iraq just like I predicted. I'm really good at this stuff.

You know, they say, "Donald Trump " and they never put in what I say. For instance they say, "Donald Trump wants Japan to arm and wants Japan to go nuclear." No, I never said that. I said, " I want them to pay us to defend them, and if they won't perhaps someday they're just going to have to at it alone." We can't continue to be the policeman of the world.

(APPLAUSE)

The dishonest press, of which many of those cameras are rolling right now, they're the most dishonest human beings. I don't know, Ted Cruz is right up there. These are the most dishonest human beings in the world.

I watch what I say and I say it very carefully. I'm like smart, I say carefully. And I always say, they have to pay. I don't want make threats, I just say, you gotta reimburse us, you gotta help us out. We owe $19 trillion, soon to be $21 trillion, you've got to take care of us.

Somebody was saying the other day, a general was on television, first of all, a general should not be on television. I don't want our generals on television. I will prohibit them. I don't want them saying things like, "our nation has never been so ill-prepared." I don't want, even though it's true, I don't want the enemy knowing that. I want to build it up before they find out.

I don't want them going on television. Our generals, you think General George Patton or General Douglas MacArthur, do you think they'd be on television saying about how weak we are? Number one, they wouldn't be on television because they'd be knocking the hell out of the enemy they wouldn't have time, OK.

But I mean, I see -- a certain general, I don't want to mention his name because he's a high quality guy. He's getting ready to leave a year ago. He said, "We are less prepared now than at any point, our Army -- and I think he said, "in our history." Now that's a long time. That's assuming the last 34 years but I think he said our history.

So assuming that's true, which I believe it is, I don't want everybody to know about it. They did a piece on "60 Minutes, " they talked about our nuclear arsenal. Did anyone see that? It was a disaster, talking about the phones don't work, the equipment's old, we don't know if anything works. I don't want people to know about it but we gotta fix it. We got to fix it.

We never want to use it. We never want to use. We never want to use nuclear. But you know what, there are nine countries right now that have it. There are other people trying to get it. We at least have to be prepared. I never -- I'm the one that didn't want to go into Iraq. You know, a lot of people say, "Trump is definitely the toughest guy of all the candidates, " Great, big deal. I hope I'm the smartest.

The combination is good. But if he's tough, he may have a quick finger. I'll have the slowest finger you can imagine. I'll be the slowest. Again, that's what I tell -- no Iraq, we did it. Take the oil, we didn't do it. Well, we're leaving, I said, "take the oil." You know, if we took the oil, ISIS wouldn't be able to fuel themselves.

Did you know Libya was just totally Hillary Clinton? That was her brilliant thing. I mean, this woman is a disaster, she's a disaster.

No, no, she's a disaster.

You know what Bernie Sanders said? "She's essentially not equipped to be president." You know, they stopped him very, very quickly. They stopped him. Don't say these things. You're going to give Trump ideas. Believe me, I got them already. I got them.

(APPLAUSE)

I got them. He said -- he said she's not qualified to be president. He said that. I said, "tell me -- tell me he didn't say that. That's too good to be true." He said -- look at this. I wrote because I want the exact -- he said not qualified to be president. Now that's a big stretch but he said she suffers from bad judgment. It's true. It's true.

(APPLAUSE)

Emails -- bad judgment. Iraq -- voted yes. Bad judgment. Libya, bad judgment. All bad judgment. So now what's happened? Libya has great oil. Gadhafi -- Gadhafi, well she wanted -- hey. She wanted to -- she wanted to get rid of Gadhafi. She wanted to get rid of Gadhafi and they wanted to get rid of Saddam Hussein. You know what they had in common? One thing they had in common. They killed terrorists, right?

But look at Libya, look at Libya. Oil that's so pure and ISIS has it now. ISIS has -- we're not doing anything about it and the oil that ISIS has outside of Libya they're making a lot of money. We didn't take the oil. We should have taken the oil but they let Gadhafi -- why? Would we have been better off if our people didn't do anything? They killed terrorists.

So we've got to get smart. We've got to get smart and we've got to get smart fast and we have to start investing money. And we have to get ISIS and we have to get ISIS out. And we have to build our military. We have to build our military which is totally been depleted.

(APPLAUSE)

And we have to take care of our vets who have been treated worse than illegal immigrants. We have to take care of our vets.

(APPLAUSE)

Have to take care of our vets. Our greatest people. So here's what's going to happen. Here's what's going to happen. Somebody gave me a hard time on Saddam Hussein. Well, he was a bad man. I know he was a bad man but he controlled that region and frankly he didn't let happen what's happening now. Take a look at Iraq. Turn on your televisions, they're rioting in Iraq.

They took over the whole thing. It's a total disaster and you take a look at Libya, you take a look at what's going on. Look at the oil that's pouring out funding wars all over the place and we don't do anything about it. So here's what we're going to do.

You're going to remember in five years and 30 years, hopefully in 50 years if you're young enough and healthy enough but you're going to remember this day but more importantly you're going to remember tomorrow. Because tomorrow we got to get out and vote. Tomorrow's so important. Tomorrow's so...

(APPLAUSE)

A guy like Ted Cruz can never -- he doesn't have the temperament. He doesn't have the temperament believe it or not. A guy like Ted Cruz cannot do it. Kasich can't do it. I call him one in 42. He's won one race in 42. That was Ohio and I would have won if I went there for two more days and campaigned.

But they gave me a dirty poll in Florida and I said I better stay in Florida. So I won Florida easily and I should have got to -- frankly -- you know that story. But I should have gone back to Ohio. I would have won. Then I could have said he's oh for 42 or whatever the number is. It keeps increasing every week.

But I will promise you one thing. We will be the smart country from now on, not the dummies, OK? Not the dummies because this is a movement that's going on.

We have a movement going on the likes of which this country has never seen they say. Time Magazine -- many covers of what's going on with the movement. I'm the messenger. This is the movement, and it's a movement like we've never -- like we've never -- like they've never seen. Bill O'Reilly said the other night that in his lifetime, this is the greatest phenomena -- political phenomena that he's ever seen, what's happened with Trump and us.

(APPLAUSE)

That's a big (INAUDIBLE). Smart guy, tough guy. And many people have said the same thing. But I say we have to win and I don't just need nomination. We'll beat Hillary. That's why I'm so happy with that poll because these guys won't beat Hillary. They won't beat her.

(APPLAUSE)

As soon as Kasich gets the first negative ad -- I told you, 60,000. It's up to now 60,000. As soon as Kasich gets the first negative ad, boom. As soon Cruz gets some negative ads, boom. I was at 60,000 negative ads. I mean, one thing, you know me, folks. Mandy, you know me. But 60,000 -- $100 million of negative ads and I'm beating Hillary in the last polls, and the other ones were tied. But -- but -- and I haven't started.

(APPLAUSE)

Folks, and I haven't started yet. Don't forget senators, governors, top people, smart people, 17, boom, boom. Walker gone, this one gone, Bush gone -- low energy -- Bush gone, all gone. All gone. Smart people, Dr. Ben Carson who endorsed me. Smart guy, great guy. He endorsed me. Great guy. Chris Christie, great guy. He endorsed me. But all smart people and I -- now, I'm going to start focusing on Hillary. That's going to be so easy, it's going to be so great. It's going to be so great.

(APPLAUSE)

Bad judgment. Crooked Hillary, remember? Crooked Hillary. Bad judgment. I didn't say it, Ben -- you know, I didn't say it. A lot of people said -- a lot of people brought it to my attention. Ben brought it to my attention, other did. But it was said by Bernie, so I don't -- I can't take any -- can I take heat if Bernie said it? So here's the story. Bernie said bad judgment, and it's true. Look at the email scandal. That's bad judgment. You'd almost say what is the purpose of doing it? It's just her. It's bad, bad judgment. It's also criminal, by the way, and a lot of bad things should happen. But we'll find out. We'll find out. It's a very criminal act. A lot of people have suffered greatly for doing much less.

So here's the story. Hopefully tomorrow, everybody here -- and you'll bring 10 people with you, everybody -- we'll go and vote 20. I like that. I like that.

(APPLAUSE)

And by the way, you think they have the bad seats? Actually, they have the best. You people are better locations and can see better, but they're going to be famous tomorrow because they're behind. You don't...

(APPLAUSE)

They'll be so famous, they'll be out to Hollywood. But hopefully, you'll be out to vote, and you're going to look back and you're going to say in many years from now, it was the greatest vote that you've ever cast because our country will start winning again. We're going to win with our military. We're going to knock of ISIS. Have to do it. Have to do it. Boom, they're cutting. Have to do it.

(APPLAUSE)

We're going to win with our vets. We're going to take care of them. We're going to take proper care of our vets. These are our great people.

(APPLAUSE)

We're going to win with education, Common Core out, bring it local. We're going to win, win, win. We're going to get rid of Obamacare, we're going replace it with something absolutely great and for much less money.

(APPLAUSE)

We're going to win at the border. We're going to build the wall. The wall will be built.

(APPLAUSE)

Mexico will pay for the wall 100 percent -- 100 percent. Mexico will pay for the wall. Now, they're accepting it already. Now they're just saying about paying. The other day they said, "Well, maybe the wall gets built." Well, a year ago, they're saying, "We'll never allow one." Now, they sell, "We'll allow, but we'll never pay." I said, "They'll pay. You watch."

By the way, remember this, 58 -- $58 billion trade deficit with Mexico, right? The wall is going to cost $10 billion. Anybody that's in business or you don't have to be in business, when you hear those numbers, it's real easy folks. It's real easy. Mexico will pay for the wall. OK, just remember that.

(APPLAUSE)

And we're going to go from the worst trade deals ever made in the history of the world. We're going to make great trade deals. And we're going to bring our jobs back to Indiana and other places in our country. And we're going to become a dynamic economy again. And we're going to become a great country again.

What's it going to be folks? It's going to be America First. Every deal is going to be America First. We want to work with people but it's going to be America First and we will make and I promise, we will make America Great Again.

Go out and vote. Thank you everybody. Thank you. Thank you everybody.

(APPLAUSE)

DONALD TRUMP: And she had a speech this morning and she's reading teleprompters. You know, if she has a group of 12 people, she's got teleprompters in front. And then she doesn't do news conferences. She hasn't done one in, like, what is it, 237 days? Something like that. She hasn't done a news conference in something like 237 days. And -- and honestly, the reason is, you couldn't do a news conferences because they'll ask her about all the different things that she's done. They'll ask her about the FBI saying she's a liar. They'll ask her about all of the emails that she deleted or erased or got rid of. 33,000 emails.

You know the ones that were done -- the ones that were done for her yoga class, right. Yoga. Yoga. The ones that were done for the wedding. 33,000. I've done a lot of weddings. I haven't sent -- oh, 33,000. I mean, how stupid is everybody? How stupid are we to hear this? 33,000 emails for the yoga. Yoga, and a wedding, and they were personal.

I'll bet you in this room we have people that probably -- I'm not a big email person. You know why? I'm intelligent. I know about email. I'm not -- I don't like email. You know what I like? I like the old days. I like the -- because today they just announced somebody else was hacked and another group was hacked. Everybody's being hacked. OK They have no idea who's doing it. They have no idea who's doing it.

These things are amazing. You know, the kids growing up, I have a young boy, Baron. He's very smart but he's using the computer so much we put it on lock, right. No way he can find out. I mean, I don't know what happened. So we go back about an hour later, and he's playing with the computer. We had it on lock. And we said, wait a minute, we had it on lock. You needed a sequential number. And we said, Baron, how did you do that? I'm not telling you, dad.

(LAUGHTER)

No, this kid's a genius. And it's getting worse and worse because they live with it. You know, I grew up and it was a certain age they start, now they live with it. It's like -- it's like their right arm. They can do it so well. And I like the old days, especially for the military and things like that, right. You want to attack. Or you want to do something. It's called courier. It's called let's put it in a thing, put it in an envelope and let's hand it to the general.

Let's not send it over the wires so everybody's probably reading it, right?

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

And no matter how good -- no matter how good they say it is, it's not -- I mean, people can hack it, I guess. It's just terrible, and you know, if you talk about military, if you talk about all these secrets, and you even talk about politics or you talk about all of this stuff, it's very confidential stuff. And then you find out the hacking is all over the place.

I hear China is brutal. They say Russia is excellent. And you have guys sitting in their home that are very good. You have people, men and women, sitting in their homes that are better than the people that are the inventors. And I don't know. There's something about -- you know, General Douglas McArthur, right? They've had a guy come, he says, sir, here it is. That's it. The risk is from there to there.

General George Patton. I guarantee you, General George Patton, who was rough as hell, he wouldn't be doing emails when he's going to be ready to attack. If he were around, he'd say, I don't like that system at all. So -- thank you, darling. I love you. I --

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

I love you. I love you and I think it's a guy. I mean, I don't know. Who the hell cares. Thank you. No, it's not. Beautiful. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Now I see you. I like that much better. I appreciate that. So -- thank you, honey. I don't know. Hey, the thousands of people on the other side that the fire marshals aren't being very nice to, they don't love me so much right now. OK. But that's OK. And we're going to come over and see them when this is finished. Should I do that or should I stay with you longer? Let's go over, right?

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

We'll come over. We're going to come over. We're going to come over. So a lot of things happened. I found last night, interesting, because we're going to get a lot of Bernie supporters, I think. And -- and Bernie made a big mistake. The mistake he made, and this is the beauty of doing speeches like this because it was late in the night and I saw it.

And she was thanking Bernie and talking about Bernie. And he's sitting there like glum. Did you notice that? No smile. His wife pats him on the back. And she pulled her hand away. Whoa. Whoa. Did you see that? A pat on the back. Darling, I love you. And pulls it back. And she was a little bit concerned there. But he was angry. And then a second time they showed him, he was angry.

And you know what, honestly, he made a big mistake because we have the best movement of all. We have far more people than anybody. We have the most important -- I tell people, Bill O'Reilly said the greatest thing, the phenomenon he's ever seen in politics. This, us, all of us.

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

All of us. You, you, you, you, you. All the people outside. Man. There are people lined up in the driveway all the way up. But this is one of the great movements in the history of our country. Our movement is much better than Bernie. But I'll tell you what, Bernie blew it. He sold his soul to the devil. He did. He had a great thing.

I was so surprised because he seemed like a tough guy. He was like tough, tough, tough, tough. And then in the end, he folded. And I said yesterday -- and it's true. He wanted to go home. He wanted to go to sleep. OK, that's what it was.

(LAUGHTER)

But you know, had he not folded and his people haven't folded because his people were angry. Now just to show you how unfair it is, if that would have happened in the Republican convention, they would have said, catastrophic evening, people are screaming. Did you see when they had the moment of silence for the police? And by the way, the only reason the police were up on that stage on the fourth night was because I was complaining they don't have any police up there, right?

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

They put the police up because they were getting a lot of heat. But they don't mean it. The difference is I mean it, OK. We're going to be law and order, and I mean it. We're going to be great. We're going to be great.

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

But did you see what happened when they had the moment of silence for the police? Tough situation. Tough situation. Not good. Not good. And then you had Bernie and he makes the deal. And then they pick a vice president that's exactly the opposite of Bernie. OK. He believes in TPP, which is a disaster, by the way. We'll never approve it. They'll approve it. How about where Terry McAuliffe, the governor of Virginia, comes out and said, don't worry, Hillary will approve it after the election.

See, that's the way it is. And it will take your jobs away almost as bad as NAFTA, which was approve by Bill Clinton. Right? NAFTA, a disaster. NAFTA has cleaned out so many states in this country. I -- look, New York state, you look at New York state, you look at New England, you look at Pennsylvania, what NAFTA has done to Pennsylvania where these companies moved to Mexico. A friend of mine is a builder. He builds plants. Plants. If you told him to build a department, he wouldn't know where to begin. He builds plants. Big, big plants. One of the biggest. And he -- maybe I'll use him to build the wall. What a great idea.

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

I got a lot of smart people. Somebody shouts out, let him build a wall.

AUDIENCE: Build that wall. Build that wall.

DONALD TRUMP: We will.

AUDIENCE: Build that wall. Build that wall. Build that wall. Build that wall. Build that wall. Build that wall.

DONALD TRUMP: We have smart people. But this guy builds big, big plants. You know, automobile plants and computer, technology plants. And this is what he builds. He builds plants. One of the biggest, maybe the biggest. One of the biggest. And he started off building in the United States years ago. And he'd build plants in the United States. So I see him the other day and I say, how's it going? Good. How's business? Unbelievable.

I said, great. I thought that was good for the United States. Right? I said, how many plants you building? Many. He said, you've got to see what's happening in Mexico. Now, by the way, this guy's better than a consultant. If I hire a consultant, I'll hire some guy that, you know, that's terrible, to tell me what's happening. Right? They'll charge a million bucks. He'll give you a report in seven months from now. They have to take a long time, otherwise they can't charge as much.

This guy tells me in two minutes. In one minute I learned better about what's happening from him, talking to him about how's his business, than I can learn from some phony consultant because if he was any good, he would have been the one building the plants, right, you know. So --

(APPLAUSE)

So an amazing thing. An amazing thing. So I said, so what's going on? He goes, you got to see Mexico. It's the eighth wonder of the world. He said, we are building the biggest, the most sophisticated, the most incredible plants all over Mexico.

I said, what about the United States? Not so good. Like, who cares. And actually, he'd much rather build in the United States but not so good. He said not so good. And I said, what does that mean? He said, well, we're doing a little work but not much. But, Donald, you have to see Mexico. I said, no thanks. But he goes, he goes, he goes, what we're doing there is incredible.

How stupid are we, folks? How stupid are we? Our companies are moving to Mexico and other places while Crooked Hillary Clinton, who's crooked as a $3 bill, while Crooked Hillary Clinton sits there and makes up stories. Donald Trump didn't do well in his campaign. I said, I just beat 18 people or 17 people, whatever. Donald Trump -- no, no, it was all written by -- all written by -- it's what Politico. I can't believe I'm talking about Politico. Because Politico is terrible to me.

But Politico wrote all cliches, not good, OK. But somebody wrote it, she probably didn't notice it. But I'm being recognized for having done one of the most legendary campaigns in the history of politics in this country. And --

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

And she puts in her thing right after the tweet, if somebody tweets, he gets upset. I get upset? I don't get upset. I didn't get upset. Somebody wrote that. You know, it was a nice little sound bite. Right? They just announced I have over 22 million between Twitter and Facebook. 22 million people. Like, I don't get upset. If somebody tweets, I do what I do. Who cares?

I think -- I'll tell you, I think I have the best temperament or certainly one of the best temperaments of anybody that's ever run for the office of president. Ever. Because I have a winning temperament. I know how to win because my whole life I've been winning. My whole life I've been winning. And I think I have one of the best temperaments because we have to start winning, folks. We don't win anymore. We can't beat ISIS. We can't beat China in trade. And then they go and build this massive fort in the middle of the South China Sea, which they're not supposed to be doing. They only do it because they don't respect us.

So they take our money, they take our jobs, they take everything. They sell us the products. No tax, come on in. Our manufacturers want to sell to China. They can't get in. And if they ever do get in, they have to pay a tax. It's so high. Or they have to build their plants over there. And they don't even want them to do that. Honestly, friend of mine, great, he said, he said, well, we don't want your product. And then they gave a tax -- which I won't even say because it's so high nobody's going to believe it.

But then they said build your plant over here but we don't even want you to. We don't even want -- they don't even want us there, OK. They don't want us to build. Now, Boeing, they ordered 300 jets, and they made Boeing build massive plants. And watch what happens in Seattle and watch what happens in a number of years when those plants are built. Watch what happens in South Carolina, where I love those people in South Carolina. They gave me the biggest victory. Remember I was supposed to lose?

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

I was supposed to lose. Highly evangelical, but the evangelicals love me. Highly evangelical, I won with the evangelicals, highly military. South Carolina, big military. Colorado, big military.

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

Big military. Big. And I went in and you watch what they do. South Carolina built big Boeing plants. They have a big, big plant. Beautiful. I love seeing it. I love seeing this stuff. They actually move part of their operation from Seattle. Seattle, big plants. So they think it's good. New plants, everything good. Great people, great labor force. But China is forcing them to build plants in China.

Now when China devalues its currency and when Boeing, in a number of years -- just remember I said it. Oh, don't worry, if I'm president, it won't happen. It won't happen. President.

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

If I'm president, Boeing will be very happy, believe me, because it won't -- they may be unhappy that they built the plant in China, but they're not going to have to worry about South Carolina and Seattle. But remember I said it. Just in case we don't make it because you people get lazy and don't vote, OK. Colorado is very important. Very important. So just remember I said it. When that plant's finished, when they start operating, and when China does a massive devaluation of its currency, and when you go and order your brand new jetliners for all of the different airlines and when they find out that the planes are going to be made in China, not in South Carolina and not in Seattle, not in this country, because we have people that are incompetent running our country.

When you see that, and I hope you don't see that because if you see that, that means that I didn't win and that won't be good. That won't be good. So here's the story, folks. When you see that, if you see that, it'll be a sad day. And I told the Boeing folks, I said to Boeing, I said, you know, you have a big investment. What happens if the plant that they're being forced to build in China becomes much more active and you start making all of your planes there. Oh, well, I don't think that will ever happen.

Watch. Watch. We're dealing with grand masters of currency manipulation. One of the reasons among many that I'm against Transpacific Partnership is they don't cover currency manipulation. And in fact, one of my opponents in politics fought very, very hard that no currency manipulation be mentioned in the documents.

This is a U.S. politician. I won't mention the name. I won't -- I should but I won't.

(CROSSTALK)

The people -- you know what, call Washington. They'll tell you. They didn't want currency manipulation mentioned. Currency manipulation is the single biggest tool that foreign governments use to beat us. And to destroy our companies and to destroy our trade. And to get rich and to rebuild their countries as we suffer. We're like a third-world country. We have rotten airports. We have airports -- you go over to Dubai, you go over to places in China, you go over to other places in the Middle East, you'll see airports the likes of which you've never seen.

I went to Dubai a number of years ago, and they were treating me great. I mean, it was great. Great visit, unbelievable what's happened there. But they have an airport that's so unbelievable. So the head of the airline is showing me around. And it's really good. And I'm looking at the terminal. I say, this is one of the most -- and I'm good, I'm -- you know, I'm a really good builder. I build under budget and ahead of schedule.

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

By the way, I had a meeting with your great newspaper, and I really like the editorial board of that newspaper, OK. You know who I'm talking about. These are great people. And they were telling there's a veteran's administration hospital that had a $1.2 billion cost overrun in this area. No, no, think of that. Think of this. I'm building a hotel in Washington, and I'm under budget and ahead of schedule by one year. Think of it. And it's peanuts compared to $1.2 billion.

What is this? That's just a cost overrun. And this is happening all over the country. When you build a road, when you build an airport. Some of the richest people in this country are people that can't even read or write. They're called friends of mine, contractors.

(LAUGHTER)

They might not read or write, but they're a lot smarter than the guys coming out of Harvard. I want to tell you. They can take them -- they can take them and wrap them around their finger. No, I did an editorial board meeting a little while ago. I really like that group. Of course, if they write badly about me, I'll take it back. OK. We'll be back here again many times. You'll get so sick of me.

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

And I'll tell you, and I'll tell you then, I dislike that group very much. No, I liked them. And smart people. But they're telling me about a hospital built in the area. You know -- you all know what I'm talking about. $1.2 billion. I said, wow. I thought I didn't hear the original, the cost over. I said, wow, that's a lot of money for a hospital. How big is it? They said, no, no, no, that's not the cost of that. That's just the cost overrun.

Think of what we could do if we had real people running our government, OK. There's what --

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

There $1.2 billion -- and I have friends. We know how to build ahead of schedule. We build. We build buildings. They come in under budget. They come -- I have friends that can do this. If one of the people that I know, some New York killer builder or somebody, built that building, it would have been up two years ago. It would have been finished like a year after it started. It's not even a tall building. That's easy. Because it takes longer to build a tall. Height means length, remember that. OK. But -- but one of my friends, (INAUDIBLE), the thing would have been thrown up so fast, and it would have been better, better than it is now.

I'll tell you a little quick story. I got called before the United Nations. I heard they were building an extension to the United Nations in New York. Number of years ago. And Jeff Sessions is such an amazing man. And he's great. He was the first senator to endorse Donald Trump. First really major political guy. Very smart guy. But they have -- I built a building across the street like for $320 million. And it's a very tall building. Like around 90 stories tall. That's tall. Much taller than the United Nations. And then it was -- and I built it for I think it was $325 million. All right. Condominiums. It's called Trump World Tower. Great building. Beautiful. Really beautiful. All glass. It's beautiful.

Herbert Muschamp for "The New York Times," the architecture critic, prior to passing away, they gave it a great review. So we built this building, and it's announced. And I get a call from -- I think it was the Swedish ambassador. But one of the ambassadors, very good man. And he said, Mr. Trump, I'm with the United Nations. I'm the ambassador. Again, I think it was Sweden. It was a while ago. Said, I don't understand something. We're talking about doing an expansion of the United Nations. Not a big deal. And it's going to cost $1.5 billion.

I read that your building, which is three times taller or more, costs $325 million. Is that possible or is that a mistake? I said totally possible, Mr. Ambassador. They said, why -- he said to me, he was good. He was a good man.

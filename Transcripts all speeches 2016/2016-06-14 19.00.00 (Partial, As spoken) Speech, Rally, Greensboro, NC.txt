DONALD TRUMP: Again, North Carolina, special place. And you know, we went through a weekend the likes of which we should never have to see again. And I wrote a few things down that I want to read because we can't let this happen anymore. We can't. We have to be so tough. We have to be so strong. We have to be so vigilant. We can't be led by weak, ineffective people! We can't. They're weak and they're ineffective!

And believe me, Hillary Clinton -- weak, ineffective. You listen to her -- I don't know if you know, she has 550 percent more people she wants to come in than Obama from a certain area where we just don't know what's going on.

(BOOS)

We don't know who they are, where they're coming from. There's no documentation. And the governors -- I just left some great governor, including, by the way, Pat, your governor. He's doing a fantastic job.

But I just left a whole group of governors and they say these people are being put in their communities. They don't even know who they are. They don't know where they're being put. They're, like, being snuck into certain communities and government and governors don't even know who's coming in to their community. What a mess we have! What a mess we have!

And I just wrote some of this down, and well, we got to do it because, normally, I talk about jobs, which nobody can compete with us on jobs. Believe me. We're going to bring them back from all these countries that have ripped us off like nobody's ever been ripped off before!

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

We're going to bring our jobs back. And guess what? We're not going to let our companies leave anymore! There's going to be a little bit of a repercussion when they start to leave. There's going to be repercussions!

But as we all know, in Orlando over the weekend, a radical Islamic terrorist killed 49 people, at least, and wounded dozens more, dozens. It was the worst terrorist attack since September 11 and the worst mass shooting in our country's history.

We want to live in a country where gay and lesbian Americans and all Americans are safe from radical Islam!

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

Which, by the way, wants to murder and has murdered gays, and they enslave women. Now, Hillary Clinton talks about women, and she talks about how she's going to do. She plays the woman card more than any human being I've ever seen in my life. And frankly, I don't even think women like her, from everything I see.

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

And yet she's taking -- she's taken $25 million from certain countries, and much more than that when you add it up, that treat women horrendously, that kill gays. And you know what's going to happen, folks, and you know what we're going to do right now? Let's call for Hillary and Bill Clinton to give back the $25-plus million to the countries that we're talking about!

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA! USA!

DONALD TRUMP: Right. So the killer's parents immigrated from Afghanistan...

(BOOS)

... as "The Washington Times" reported, the children of Muslim immigrant parents -- they're responsible for a growing number -- for whatever reason, a growing number of terrorist attacks. The killer's Afghan father supported the Taliban, which believes in violently oppressing women and gays. Violently. We're not talking anything else. We're talking violently.

Once again, we've seen that political correctness is deadly! They don't want to talk about the problem!

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

And I watched President Obama today, and he was more angry at me than he was at the shooter!

(BOOS)

And many people said that. One of the folks on television said, Boy, has Trump gotten under his skin. But he was more angry -- and a lot of people have said this. The level of anger -- that's the kind of anger he should have for the shooter and these killers that shouldn't be here!

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

Now there are reports that the wife knew about the attack. The second wife knew about the attack but may have not told the authorities. Nobody really knows. Her family reportedly is from Afghanistan.

According to Pew -- it's a Pew report -- 99 percent of the people in Afghanistan support oppressive sharia law.

(BOOS)

Immigration from Afghanistan has increased five-fold. We don't know what we're doing, folks! Every year, we bring in more than 100,000 lifetime immigrants from the Middle East and many more from Muslim countries outside of the Middle East.

A number of these immigrants have hostile attitudes. And it doesn't take a big percentage. Look what one whack-job -- look at this one whack, this one horrible savage -- look what he did in a short period of time to great young people. Look what he did and look at the carnage and devastation and destroyed families that he's caused.

So a number of these immigrants have hostile attitude toward women, toward gays, and people of different faiths, and that includes everybody. They're hostile. If you're not with them, it's, like, forget it.

Hillary Clinton's immigration plan would bring in millions of unvetted immigrants, or very poorly vetted. And how can you vet somebody when you have no idea where they come from, you have no idea about the paperwork? Frankly, they have better passports than we do because they stole our passport machines! How that happened is pretty amazing, all right? Including those who hate gays, women, Jews, Christians, everybody.

MATT LAUER: Welcome to Cleveland.

DONALD TRUMP: Thank you very much.

MATT LAUER: Can I be the first to welcome you?

DONALD TRUMP: You can indeed.

MATT LAUER: Is it surreal to finally be here? We've talked about this week for so long.

DONALD TRUMP: I think it's just a great feeling. It's a great accomplishment. But the real accomplishment, and you know what it is, make America great again. That's why I'm doing it for. That's why I'm doing it.

STEVE WOMACK: The question is on adoption of the resolution.

MATT LAUER: Already there's been a couple of contentious moments. I know you've heard about this. An entire delegation walked out today over a vote they wanted and didn't get.

STEVE WOMACK: The ayes have it.

MATT LAUER: What's your reaction to it?

DONALD TRUMP: It wasn't really a vote about me. That was about changing rules in the year 2020.

MATT LAUER: Well, they wanted the rules changed now, but it would have never taken place until 2020.

DONALD TRUMP: And we got more votes than anybody in the history of the Republican Party. It's never happened like this. And I think the press liked to build it up. But it really was about rules changes for 2020.

MATT LAUER: There's been so much violence in the country in the last couple of weeks. People are on edge. They're tense. You add to that, the passion that comes with political debate. And there are people who are truly afraid that things could boil over here in Cleveland. Would you be willing to make a pledge to speak to everyone involved in this convention and say, please tone down the rhetoric?

DONALD TRUMP: Sure. And I think it's going to be toned down. I think it's going to be a great rhetoric. But there's also going to be law and order. We need law and order in the country.

MATT LAUER: So can you say to the people who are going to take to that podium this week, no personal attacks, no vitriol. Keep it civil?

DONALD TRUMP: I think to a large extent, you know, it is a convention after all. And when you say civil, we can't be too civil when you have a situation like Hillary Clinton with all that she's done and all of the mistakes that she's made. So they'll be brought up. But I do think it will be very, very civil.

MATT LAUER: I watched your interview on 60 Minutes with your running mate Governor Mike Pence.

DONALD TRUMP: Right.

MATT LAUER: One of the things that came up in that was his vote in support of the Iraq war. You said in that interview, everyone is entitled to make a mistake.

DONALD TRUMP: Right.

MATT LAUER: You've been hammering Secretary Clinton on that exact same vote --

DONALD TRUMP: Sure.

MATT LAUER: -- for the better part of a year. Have you lost the right now to do that?

DONALD TRUMP: No, not at all. She's made a lot of mistakes. She makes too many mistakes.

MATT LAUER: But what's different about her vote --

DONALD TRUMP: She's got a bad judgment.

MATT LAUER: -- for that war versus Governor Pence?

DONALD TRUMP: Because she's wrong on the war. She's wrong on Syria. She's wrong on Libya. She's wrong on everything. She's got bad judgment. And Bernie Sanders said it. I said it also. But Bernie Sanders said she suffers from bad judgment. And she also suffers, Matt, from bad instincts.

MATT LAUER: Your campaign adviser Mister Manafort picked a little bit of a fight with the governor of this state. He criticized Governor Kasich for not showing up at this convention and supporting you. And Paul Manafort said he's being petulant and he's embarrassing the state of Ohio. Do you agree?

DONALD TRUMP: Well, look, he signed a pledge, number one. But honestly, he got beaten so badly. I won I guess thirty-seven states. Even more than that. And he won one. If I got beaten that badly, I wouldn't show up either. So he doesn't have to show up. It's fine.

MATT LAUER: But do you want to pick a fight with a popular governor of a state like Ohio in the early stages of this election.

DONALD TRUMP: He might not be popular after the convention. I don't mind that he's not here.

MATT LAUER: So is he embarrassing --

DONALD TRUMP: I think it's fine.

MATT LAUER: -- the state of Ohio by not showing up?

DONALD TRUMP: I don't want to say that. I love Ohio.

MATT LAUER: Last thing, what do you want to come out of this week? I mean you get to start it off tonight, Mrs. Trump. What -- what are you hoping for? What would be a success for you?

MELANIA TRUMP: We want secure and safety for all Americans and also people around the world. What is going on now is not acceptable. We need love and compassion and kindness to bring us all together.

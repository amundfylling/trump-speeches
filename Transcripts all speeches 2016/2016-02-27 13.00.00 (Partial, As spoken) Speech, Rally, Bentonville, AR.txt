DONALD TRUMP: Wow. Thank you, Chris. Thank you very much. I really appreciate it.

Look at this turnout. This is incredible. And there are many people outside that can't get into the hangar. The fire marshal won't let them in. Oh, fire marshal, let me talk to you, please. Please. But it's such an honor, and you know, we've had tremendous results here. And I think we're going to do very well here. We're going to do well everywhere. I think the only place we're tied actually is Texas, we're tied in Texas. And I think we have a really good chance of winning Texas. People are so tired of these politicians, it's all talk. No action.

And I've been watching it, I've dealt with them all my life. I've been watching it all my life. I got a little glimpse of it just now coming in. I watched this lightweight Rubio, total lightweight, and little mouth on him, bing, bing, bing. Bing, bing, bing, bing.

And his new attack is he calls me a con artist. I'm a con man, right? You know, I built a great business. And believe me, I wish my father loaned me $200 million or gave me $200 million. I wish he had $200 million in those days. I'll tell you what, I wish my father gave me that money. I borrowed a tiny amount of money, $1 million, I started a business, it's worth much more than $10 billion right now. I filed unbelievable statements with the FEC, Federal Elections, and the press knows, they fully understand because they went down there, they were, like, a bunch of ants. They were all over the place.

And they were so disappointed to see what a great company it is. Some of the great assets of the world. Very little debt. Tremendous cash flow and it says it all. First time I've ever done that because I'm a private company. And believe me, if I didn't have a good statement I wouldn't have been able to run because I wouldn't have been able to file. And the filing is amazing. And the company is amazing.

And the reason I tell you that is because that's the thinking we need. We have $19 trillion in debt. We're going up to $21 trillion as a country. Our country is a mess. We're losing our business. Companies are moving into Mexico. They're moving to China. They're moving to Ireland. Pfizer just announced they're going to move to Ireland. Great company. They're moving to Ireland. They're moving all over the world. They're leaving us.

And our numbers, that 5 percent number you hear unemployment. Total fiction. It's probably 25 percent, could even be 30 percent. Because when somebody looks for a job and they give up like most people do, they go home, they say, I can't do it anymore. They're considered statically employed.

We have a really problem, folks, and we're going to get it solved. OK? We're going to get it solved.

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

But I will address, you know, little Rubio. This guy has a fresh mouth. He's a very nasty guy. And I actually thought that Ted Cruz was a liar, but Rubio is worse. I mean, he's worse. And I watched -- I must tell you, one of the reasons I love having Chris. And Chris called me a couple of days ago, he said, you know what, what you have is a movement. I've never seen anything it. He said, and he's a pro. He's one of the real endorsements that I wanted. And he called me. I would have called him, I was sort of like getting ready to call him. And out of the blue Chris called and he said I want to endorse you and your campaign. I've never seen anything like it. And many people have never seen anything like it.

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

Peggy Noonan who is terrific. She writes a fantastic piece today in "The Wall Street Journal" talking about it. What's happening is amazing. "TIME" magazine, a few weeks ago, a cover story, the movement that we've created. But just to address, so I was in New Hampshire which we won, by the way. We, not me, we. We won. And I saw a meltdown of a human being like I've never seen. It was Rubio. And it was Chris who started. And I'll tell you what, he is one prosecutor, isn't he? In all fairness.

But he started. And he looked at Rubio, and they went back and forth, all of a sudden -- and you have to understand, I'm in the center -- I've been the center for every single debate now which is nice. Center means good. I told CNN, well, are you going to announce that I'm number one? No. I said well, nobody is going to know I'm number one unless you announce it. They said you're in the center. I said, I don't care. Nobody knows that. But they don't want to do that.

They should do that, right? But thye don't want to do that. They never want to do that stuff. They never want to do anything good. I'm not just talking about them, I'm talking about the other ones, too. The media, the most dishonest human beings on earth, I'm telling you.

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

The most. And we're going to -- by the way, while I'm on that subject, I am going to do everything I can, if I win, they write false stories, they write nasty false stories and they know they're false, I've had some written more than I've ever seen before in the last period of a few months. They write false stories you can't really sue because the libel laws are essentially nonexistent.

We're going to open up the libel laws so when they write falsely, we can sue the media and we can get the story corrected and get damages. All right. Believe me.

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

So important. And you know what, it will be amazing how honest they become. Right now they can say anything they want to say. Some day in the not too distant future if I win, they're not going to get away with the stuff that they get away with and I think we all feel -- don't we all feel that way? It's terrible. Very, very dishonest people. But I watched Chris go after this lightweight Rubio. I call him lightweight Rubio. I watched it.

And I'm sitting here and he's over here, somebody on my left, doesn't matter. And he's over here, and I see him starting to sweat. Like I have never seen anything like it. Thank God he has really large ears, the biggest ears I've ever seen, because they were protecting him. It was going -- I have never seen any human being sweat like this guy.

And he said the Obama statement, once. And that was fine. And then he said it twice. And I'm standing -- I had nothing to do with it because Chris is over here. He's over here. Just to my right. He said it a second time. And I said, oh, that's strange, going like this. That's strange. Then he said the same exact words. You know, he memorizes phrases, like the con man. I saw Bret Baier yesterday say I never -- he said con man so many times during the interview. Trump's a con man. Trump's a con man.

The last thing I am is a con man, folks. I built a great business, OK? I built a great business.

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

And by the way, think of this, then I do a television show call The Apprentice and it becomes one of the top shows on television, tremendously successful, and by the way, they wanted to renew me, and I couldn't do it because I was doing this. And Steve Burke, the head of Comcast, great guy, comes into my office. Donald, we want to renew you, I said, Steve, I'm going to run for president. You can't do both. OK? It's called equal time laws or whatever it's called but you can't.

He said, please, please. I said no, I'm going to do this. And we chose because I have a big, you know, stake in The Apprentice going forward and everything else. And we chose Arnold Schwarzenegger. Let's see how he does. Right? Let's see. I hope he does well but who knows? Right? I know Trump did well. Fourteen seasons. So I had this tremendous show that was one of the most successful shows on television, and really one of the most successful. And we came up with the impression, "You're fired." And it's been -- it's been great.

And you got know my kids, Ivanka, Don, Eric and a lot of other people. And my family, I'm so proud of. But -- so we do a show, it's greatly successful. I do books, right. I do the "Art of the Deal." One of the most successful -- probably the most successful but one of the most successful business books and books of its kind ever written. And I did many other books. 12 other books. Many best-sellers.

And then I built this business that is unbelievable. Some of the greatest assets in the world. Turnberry in Scotland. Doral in Miami. Buildings all over the place. Big chunks at the Bank of America building in San Francisco. Built a city practically on the west side of Manhattan. A big chunk of 1290 Avenue of the Americas, biggest floor plates in New York. Just about the biggest floor plates, I think they are the biggest floor plates. And just built 40 Wall Street, Trump Tower, so many things.

And then I listen to this light little nothing say Trump's a con man. Isn't it a disgrace? I mean, seriously. You know, it really is -- maybe it will make the libel laws also so we can sue lying politicians, you know, because --

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

But -- but, you know, it's very insulting when you hear it. And thank goodness I have this where I can get off and counteract it b they say things that are so wrong. Now I don't know what Cruz is staying but these two guys are in big trouble. They're in big trouble. Yes. It's almost like who cares, but they're in big trouble. Rubio's won nothing. He couldn't get elected dog catcher in Florida. They hate him in the state of Florida. No, no, think of it. He's a politician, and Chris went over it, never votes, never anything. He couldn't right now if he ran for office in Florida, he wouldn't get elected to any office. They cannot stand him because Florida is like a second home. They cannot stand the guy. And he abandoned them. Think of it. He runs for Senate. He wins, they give him their confidence. He wins. And before he even runs he is looking for another position. And he never goes to vote on some of the most important bills. He's never voting. They hate him in Florida.

That's why I'm up 22 points. Can you imagine? We have -- we have a sitting senator, at least with Cruz, we're even. That's not so great for him either. Because he's a sitting senator in Texas. So -- but in Florida, we have a sitting senator, and I'm up by a tremendous amount, every poll. Because they can't stand the guy.

Now here's the story. He sat and he stood, and I thought he was going down. And I said, man, I think he's choking. I love -- you know, I love -- it's called human, whatever, I love watching whatever happens. I said, I'm about to witness history. This guy's going down. This guy's going down. And I'm looking and I'm getting ready because, you know, it's like a lot of people, I'm a pretty strong guy.

And I'm getting ready to grab him because I thought he was -- I thought he was out. And he starts sweating. And honestly, this is true. He's got a problem. I've never seen a human being sweat like he sweats. So Chris Christie is grilling him. So he says it twice. Now he says it a third time, I said, now that's not good, because three times the exact same line, memorized. And then a fourth and then a fifth. And I'm looking like wow. But I'm getting ready to grab him, because I'm telling you, he's going down.

I have never -- it looked like he jumped in a swimming pool with his clothing on and then came back. Now for the last debate, I go back and I see him with makeup and it's like he's putting it on with a trowel, OK. And then he got very aggressive right at the beginning. Now I knew they were going to do that, both of them, they double- teamed me because -- and I got great reviews. You know that every single poll, Drudge, Slate, I think "TIME" magazine, every single poll had me winning that debate, which is amazing, every single.

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

Not all of the pundits had me winning but every single poll. And many of the pundits, but not all of them, some of them no matter what, if I was Abraham Lincoln debating, he was a very good debater. They'd say it wasn't a great night. A couple of them would say it wasn't a great night. I thought it was a great night but -- right?

But I was double-teamed by these two. But with Rubio, just to finish off with him, so I knew it was going to be one of these nights because everybody was saying, they've got to do it, they have no choice because they're getting killed. We're way ahead. We're way ahead nationally. We're way ahead here and every place. We've got to win. We've got to win Arkansas. We've got to win Arkansas.

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

We've got to win. Maybe I'll start shopping permanently at WalMart if we win Arkansas.

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

I'll never go anywhere else. We've got to win Arkansas. I love it. I love the people of Arkansas. I know so many people, they are great people, these are great people. But just remember this -- that's right, thank you. But just remember this, politicians are never going to get you to the promised land. They're never, ever going to get you to the promised land. And things were said in previous speeches and probably by Cruz also but I didn't get to see Cruz, which is just false, so many things I've done so well.

For instance, they talked Trump University. It's a small deal, very small. But I got sued by a lawyer who sues. They sue because they want to see if they can get some money back. I could have settled this numerous times. I could settle it now. But I don't like settling suits. Because when you settle lawsuits, everybody sues you. It's a little business story. I have friends, they settle lawsuits and they can't understand why are they always sued. I don't settle lawsuits.

We have people at Trump University that wrote -- most of them, that wrote statements and they wrote the statement where, I love the school and I love this, for some reason -- I never saw this before -- we call them report cards, they did like report cards, essentially report cards, where at the end of the class, at the end of the period of time, they did a study, they did a report card on how you like it.

Some even did film clips where they actually are in film saying great things. The person that started the suit wrote a great statement saying, it was fantastic. And did a film clip saying that it was fantastic. And they just asked that she be taken out of the case. She doesn't want to be in the case anymore. And the reason they want is because she's a terrible plaintiff because she said all these great things about Trump University. And she's on film saying how great it is. So they put in a motion which of course the papers don't write this. They put in a motion saying to take her -- her name is Taralof or something. Take her out of the case. The reason they want her out of the case is she is a horrible, horrible witness.

She's got in writing that she loves it. And I could have settled it and when I saw her documentation, I said why would I give her money? She loved the case and she's on tape. Why would I give her money. I probably should have settled it but I just can't do that. Mentally I can't do it. I'd rather spend a lot more money and fight. The --

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

No, you got to. You got to. Hey, it would have been much easier if I settled, it would have probably been cheaper but I don't care. It would have been much easier -- it would have been cheaper. It would have been much easier but just so you understand, so these people, all it is, is people put up something and now they get letters, can you get your money back? We'll get our money back, yes, let's join.

The attorney general of New York, this is all a civil case, by the way, it's a simple civil case. The attorney general of New York meets with Barack Obama in Syracuse.

The following day, he sues me. What they don't say is I believe $15,000 or a lot of money was paid to the attorney general by the law firm in California. See, I'm giving you sort of a life experience because is this more interesting than talking about trade? A trade is easy for us. Trade is easy. But this is sort of like -- this is almost like a story on success, because this is the way the world works. This is sort of the way the world works. So the attorney general gets a campaign contribution from the law firm that's suing me.

All of a sudden the attorney general, his name is Eric Schneiderman, not respected in New York, doing a terrible job, probably is not electable in New York but who knows, and he meets with Obama, gets a campaign contribution, I think. I think it's $15,000 and all of a sudden he meets with Obama in I believe Syracuse and the following day or two he brings a lawsuit against me.

Now much of that lawsuit has been won by me. He's appealing it. It's on appeal right now. But much of that case, it's a long time already, but much of that case we won. It's won. I don't mean we settled. We've won much of that case. They missed the statute of limitations and most of it is going away but nobody writes that. Nobody wants to write that.

The rest of it we're doing very well. We have a very hostile judge because to be honest with you the judge should have thrown the case out on summary judgment but because it was me and because there's a hostility toward me by the judge, tremendous hostility, beyond belief, I believe he happens to be Spanish, which is fine. He's Hispanic, which is fine, and we haven't asked for recusal which we may do but we have a judge who's very hostile. Should have been thrown out.

Wasn't thrown out, and I say, I'd rather go to court because when you go to court and you have witnesses get up there and then they have to say, but why did you sign a document saying that you love the school, etcetera, etcetera, why should you pay money for that. So I just wanted to give you a little bit of the parameters because you keep hearing about Trump University. So it's a civil case. It's a sleazebag law firm that does these class action cases. They're very routine and I will win the case in the end.

I just didn't want to be forced to settle and I could have settled it before I did this and I knew somebody would try and use it for publicity, but I believe I can turn it around just to show you how dishonest these people are and that's the case.

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

And just to finish, if I didn't have a hostile judge in California this case would have ended years ago, would have ended a long time ago. OK, are you ready? So that took place with Rubio. Rubio's going nowhere, I think he's going nowhere. Hasn't won at all. They're fighting. Now what they want to do is they want to take Trump on individually. They're all fighting. I saw this morning, we should get out, this one should get out, that one should get out, Kasich should get out, he's a nice guy, by the way, even though -- but he's a little tougher than you think. He's another one.

He's very nice, oh, just so terrible you're fighting, it's so terrible, it's so terrible. He's always on the end, you know, close to getting out. You know, when you're on those end positions, I won't mention what I told other people but when you're on the end position that means you're close to, it's close to over. But every time these two guys were hitting me he looks like oh, that's so terrible that you guys are fighting. You know, we should have peace.

That's all good but the worst ads that were taken against me were taken by Kasich, and you know, like he's such a nice guy and he is. He's fine, but I'm in the -- I'm in New Hampshire, which we won. By the way, we won in New Hampshire. We won in Nevada. We won Nevada. We won South Carolina, it was so beautiful. And I'm watching them. I actually tweeted today we won South Carolina. We won South Carolina, what a great memory, and now I'm watching Bernie and Hillary fighting in South Carolina, and I have the victory on the Republican side.

And you know what I saw, which was amazing, we had the largest turnout in the history of South Carolina. I won by tremendous numbers, right? Landslide, right? Landslide. Beyond. And don't forget that was supposed to be 100 percent Ted Cruz. That was going to be his, you couldn't beat him there, impossible to beat him. Not only did I beat him we killed him by what was it like, 20 points? Some unbelievable amount.

I won with every single category. I won with women, with men, with evangelicals, with military, with the vets. We won with rich, we won with less than rich, we won with highly educated, we won with pretty good education, and we won with people that didn't do so much with the education but they're doing well anyway, I love them, OK. I love them. I love them. They're my people. They're my people.

But we won with virtually every category and then we go to Nevada and we went -- I mean, that was a blowout. We just won with everything. And I felt it, because that was the caucus. I was a little worried with the caucus stuff because caucuses can get a little dishonest. Can I say that word, dishonest?

And I went to one caucus, which is the biggest one in Las Vegas, and I'll tell you, there was such love, they went crazy and there were probably 2,000 people in the room, and of the 2,000 people, 100 people maybe, I don't even think that, were possibly going to vote for somebody else. Everybody was on our side, and I said this is a good sign. I got back to the room, it was long before 7:00 when the polls actually closed over there at 7:00 and they're already saying this thing is over, because they've all over the state it was the same way. And we ended up getting a tremendous victory by, it wasn't even a contest. So -- (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

Again, with evangelicals, with military, with everybody. So it's been like a great, great experience, and part of it is anger, and part of it is you're tired of the politicians. You're tired of guys --

UNIDENTIFIED: Yes.

DONALD TRUMP: You're tired -- you know what? I'm tired and you're tired of guys like little Rubio who -- you know, little mouthpiece, goes like a mile a minute. We're tired of these people. They're never going to get anything done. They're never going to get -- hey, by the way, Rubio bought a house for $178,000. He sold the house for $380,000, probably the only good deal he ever made.

(LAUGHTER)

To a lobbyist, who I think was in front of them or close to, in front of them up in the Senate, this was in Florida, wanting something approved. Now that's really dishonest. Rubio stole from the Republican Party, but you know what happened? They said you stole from the party. He says, no, I didn't. Yes, you did, you had a driveway built. No, I didn't. Yes, you did, oh, OK, well, he reimbursed them. OK?

And for some reason he didn't get indicted. Why doesn't he get indicted? I guarantee you one thing Chris Christie would have indicted him so fast.

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

But why doesn't somebody look into his house deal? Why isn't -- how can he make that kind of profit on a house to a lobbyist? And that's a problem.

People are controlled up here by lobbyists, you know that, right? We have the lobbyists and the special interests that have total control over these folks, but not Ben, because Ben is not controlled by them, although I don't know, is he getting money from -- I don't even care, Ben's such a nice guy. And by the way, what Ted Cruz did to Ben Carson was a disgrace in Iowa. That was a disgrace.

He said Ben Carson has left the race because he went to Florida. He was heading out to Florida, which is where he lives in all fairness. Ben Carson has left the race and vote for us. And at caucus, you know, you can actually take the people and walk around. I don't like caucus. I like you walk in to a voting booth, you walk, you vote and you leave like what you people are going to do, OK? I don't like this caucus stuff.

But they said Ben Carson has left the race, vote for us, and they wine him and dine him and bring him around, I bet you thousands of votes, and I would have won Iowa in my opinion if that happened because these extra votes went to him. And you know what? Honestly, if we had a strong Republican Party, they would disqualify him for what he did honestly. I mean, if I were the head of the Republican Party, I wouldn't throw him out, you know, maybe for Canada we'll throw him out, we'll see about that.

But -- because that's a serious problem. You know, he's being sued and I didn't sue him, I'm so non-litigious it's amazing, but he's being sued now. I heard he's being sued because was born in Canada, lived there four years. Who knows? I always thought you had to be born here like on this soil, right here in Arkansas.

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

So we'll find out what happens. Hey, I hope that's not the reason he has to get out. I hope we beat them, but you know what? Ted has that problem, but if I were the head of the Republican Party, I would disqualify his Iowa situation. He also did another thing. Did you ever see that? Voter violation. Did you ever see this? It's like a fraudulent document. Looks like it came out of a government agency, so professional, says voter violation, and it talks about you're in violation of all these things.

Listen to this. Essentially, this isn't exact but close enough. But if you vote for Ted Cruz and bring this in and vote for Ted Cruz, the violation is canceled. And you have people that honestly sort of believe it. I looked at one of them and I said, man, that comes right out of a government agency. That's a fraud. And I saw lawyers talking about it on some of these crazy talk shows and they said -- they said it's a fraud. I mean, it's like a fraud. I would have disqualified him from his victory in Iowa because you can't do business like that. You just can't do it. You can't do it.

Then you take everybody, move them up a notch, now I won four in a row instead of three, I like that. And it doesn't matter. I got almost the same nun of delegates. I got one less, but doesn't matter. But you can't do that stuff. You can't do that stuff.

And frankly -- but Cruz is smarter than Rubio, intellectually he's smarter than Rubio, but both they lie. You know, I deal in the real estate business. I deal in a lot of different businesses. I meet some bad people. I meet much tougher people than a Rubio or a Cruz, much tougher but I've never met people that could lie like these guys. These guys are world class liars. It's unbelievable.

And I was helped in Cruz's case because Rubio looked at him and said "you're a liar," and he was actually right because he did lie about that particular point. But once he said he was a liar I was able to say he's liar. I know politicians very well. I've dealt with them all my life. A lot of them are bad people. You have some good ones, but you have a lot of seedy, horrible people, and I've never -- and I've seen some bad stuff, I've never seen a politician call another politician a liar. When he called him a liar, I said, great, now I can call him a liar because there was so much lying.

But Rubio is probably a worse liar than Cruz. I'll pick at the end of three or four weeks, I'll give you my pick. Does that sound OK?

(APPLAUSE)

So we have an amazing story. I have decided that, with my life, if I win, I'm going to do something that's going to be so amazing for our country. We're going to have great trade deals. We have the worst trade deals ever made in history. We have trade deals that are so bad. We have deals, period, that are so bad. The Iran deal, we give $150 billion to Iran. They're now spending that money.

(BOOS)

It's one of the worst deals, forget about country to country, one of the dumbest deals I've ever seen. But all of our deals are like that. That's a horror deal. That deal, those hostages should have been back four years ago. They should have been back before you started the negotiations.

(APPLAUSE)

They go in, this guy Kerry, they go in, they go in, it's horrible. They go in, and you say we have to have our hostages back. And they'll say no, the Persians, great negotiators, Persians, always been great negotiators. They'll say no. And you'll say bye-bye, we're leaving, bye, enjoy yourself. Now they're sitting at a table, nobody on the other side of the table. And you let them know we're not going to negotiate until the hostages are released, and then you double up on the sanctions. You just go ratchet, ratchet, ratchet. Within 24 hours you'll be called. You got your hostages back, folks.

Then I go a step further and I tell the story about my father, because my father did not give me $200 million. Believe me -- oh, I told you, my sister, she calls, and I have a great sister, a great brother, they both called after the debate. "Dad never gave -- are you kidding? Where's our piece of it" you know?

(LAUGHTER)

It's unbelievable. Took $1 million, borrowed it, paid it back and that's morphed into 200. Part of the reason in all fairness to Rubio, he read that in the "New York Times." It was such a false piece the "New York Times," it's going out of business. It's the worst newspaper. It is a dead newspaper going out of business.

I'll tell you why. Unless somebody buys it, like me, as a vanity project, all right, it loses a fortune. But they are the most dishonest people at the "New York Times." They'll write, they will write, they wrote a story about me a couple, few days ago. It was so wrong, they knew it was wrong. I said then pull the story. No, we won't do that. If you know the story is wrong why won't you pull it? And they admitted it's wrong. We won't pull it. They are really dishonest. "New York Times," I call it the "failing New York Times."

It's very interesting, they bought "The Boston Globe." They paid $1.3 billion for "The Boston Globe," right, $1.3 billion. They spent a fortune, hundreds of millions of dollars on modernizing it, right? At the end of a number of years, they just sold it for essentially $1. They lost $1.5 billion. They have no money.

They sell their headquarters, this beautiful, like the cathedral. I used to go there when they had real people running the paper. It's like a cathedral, old, beautiful building on I think West 43rd or 45th, 43rd, beautiful, beautiful building. They used to call it the cathedral to journalism. They sold it to move into a horrible office building that's a horrible office building opposite the Port Authority bus terminal, horrible.

But they sold the cathedral and they sold it for, I believe, about $150 million. The guy that bought it, they're friends of mine, they flipped it for $525 million a short time later. And I say to myself, so why are we listening to their editorials? They tell you what to do, they tell you this and that. They write stories that are inaccurate. So why does anybody even read the "New York Times"? They lost $1.5 billion on a simple newspaper. They lost hundreds of millions of dollars. They should have never left their cathedral because now you walk into that place and it's like you're walking into, it's like walking down the concrete right here. There's nothing. It's just a very average office building with bars on the front of it. It's terrible.

And I say why? My friend and the group, they made hundreds of millions of dollars just buying it, keeping it for a little while, selling it. And we're supposed to listen to the "New York Times." These people are incompetent, and they're bad people. They have a bad agenda. They're really bad people. That's one of the reasons I want to straighten out the libel laws so that we can go after them because these are really bad people. These are really bad.

(APPLAUSE)

So what we're going to do is we're going to make trade deals that are going to be fantastic. We're going to get our best, and we have the greatest negotiators in the world. We have the best. We use political hacks to negotiate with China. With China, we are losing right now $500 billion, with a "b," a year, billion dollars a year, OK? That's our trade deficit. We have a trade deficit of China, with China, $500 billion. We have a massive trade deficit with Japan. They bring in millions of cars. You look at those boats in Los Angeles, they bring in millions and millions of cars. It never stops. We send them beef. We send them beef, that's the deal, OK, which is a fraction. And they don't take the beef. You know what happens? It goes back and forth, and finally they take it, they call it aged, it's Kobe beef and they sell it for ten times more. That's what happens. That's what happens. But we don't get the price, they get the price.

OK, but with Japan, same thing. With Mexico, they're killing us at the border, they're killing us with trade. You saw the other day Carrier just moved to Mexico, Carrier. It's very sad. Somebody had their cell phone going to take in the shots, everyone is devastated. And 1,400 people gone. Ford moved to Mexico, $2.5 billion plant. Nobody did anything. That was two years ago. Now they're doubling up and going to build more there. I would have let them have it so hard they would never have the guts to build more there, never have the guts.

(APPLAUSE)

Nabisco, Nabisco just moved their big plant where they make Oreos which we don't eat anymore, right, no more Oreos. That's a good thing. That's a good thing. But Nabisco just moved their plant from Chicago into Mexico, OK? No more.

Let me tell you about Carrier. I watched it because it just happened a week ago, and I watched these people, they were devastated. They were there for a long time. Good people, good air conditions, I buy a lot of Carrier air conditioners. I'm not buying them anymore, but I buy a lot of Carrier air conditioners. And I saw this executive up front, we're going to close our operations and we're going to move to Mexico. Lots of luck, folks. People are devastated.

So I went to the Wharton School of Finance, which is considered the best business school. You've got to be very smart to get into that school, very smart. The Rubios of the world could not get into that school, believe me. They don't have the capacity. Actually Cruz could, in all fairness, Cruz could. I don't know that he has the temperament. But academically, certainly. But I go to Wharton, I'm smart. You're smart. But you don't have to be smart. How do we solve the problem where all these countries are moving into these places and people like yourselves and friends of yourselves and people that I know are losing all their jobs? We're being devastated.

So here's what we're doing as an example Carrier. I would call Carrier through one of my people, because it's not cool if the president calls. The president is calling an air conditioning company. Listen, I don't like what you're doing. I may make some of the calls. They're going to say it's terribly un-presidential, but I don't care, all right?

(APPLAUSE)

They'll say it's un-presidential. When Vincente Fox, the former president of Mexico --

(BOOS)

When he used the f-bomb, I thought it would be a national thing, because I know if I used it, it would be the biggest story in the history of the world. So he used it, nobody cares. And then he was so angry. You know why he was angry? Because they're used to getting their way, right? They're used to getting their way. How dare they do this? How dare they say that? And I won't build that, you know what, wall. We will not build that, you know what, wall. See? I've learned.

(LAUGHTER)

By the way, I don't use that word. The words I use are peanuts compared -- that word I couldn't, I wouldn't be able to get off the airplane. Do you like the plane made in the United States?

(APPLAUSE)

Boeing, made in the United States. Speaking of that, Iran just ordered 118 airbus planes, nothing in the United States. They just ordered a lot of equipment from Italy and all over Europe. They just ordered missiles. I didn't know they could buy missiles with their $150 billion. They just ordered missiles from Russia, nothing from the United States. They capture our 10 wonderful sailors, they put guns to their heads, they put them in a begging position. They were scared and frightened, and they let them go two days later, because, you know what, the money was going to pass. If the money was not going to pass, if they already had the money, the billions and billions of dollars, they would have kept them. But they wouldn't have kept them if I won the race, that I can tell you. They would have been out so fast.

(APPLAUSE)

They would have been out so fast.

So, so with Carrier, I call them up, I say, folks, congratulations on your new plant. I think it's wonderful. I love that you're building it in Mexico, it's great. I hate what you ask with the 1,400 people and more. And this is also United Technologies just to shame them because they laid off additional people where they're going to Mexico. Mexico is becoming the new China. You better be careful folks. And their leaders are much smarter than our leaders, and they are ripping us not only at the border but they're ripping us like crazy with trade.

So I'd say to the head of Carrier, congratulations on the new plant. But here's the story, folks. Every single air conditioner that you make as it passes the border, and we will have a real border, OK?

(APPLAUSE)

We will have a real border, the illegals will not be able to carry those air conditioners in, OK, because we're going to have a real border, and we're going to have a wall and it's going to be a real wall, folks.

(APPLAUSE)

And by the way, congratulations, Mexico, you're paying for the wall, just so you understand. Congratulations.

(APPLAUSE)

So I would say to them, every air conditioner that you make that goes into the United States and over our border, every single one, you're going to pay a 35 percent tax on, OK?

(APPLAUSE)

Now some of the stupid people, because I'm a conservative person but I like to say I'm a conservative person with common sense, all right. Some of the stupid people say oh he's not a free trader. No, no, I'm a smart trader. I'm a fair trader. I'm a free trader, but it's got to be fair. When China is making $500 billion on trade deficits, I'm not a free trader, folks, because when you try and do business in China, they charge you tax. I have many friends. They can't do business in China. They can't get their product into China. China dumps it over here. You can't get it over there. When he does get it in, it's a big tax, OK.

So I'd say to Carrier, congratulations, but you're paying the 35 percent tax. Here's what will happen. I'll do it early before they start building, I like to get them -- here's what's going to happen. Mr. President, no, you can't do that. That's not free trade like all these stupid people, they talk about free trade. We want free trade, Mr. President. That's not free trade. I'd say, here's the story. I'm just telling you, every single unit you make comes over that border, you're paying a 35 percent tax, and that's going to make up for all the jobs we lost and everything else. And I hope it works in your bottom line.

(APPLAUSE)

So here's what will happen. If I am one of these characters like a Rubio, take a look at who is giving him money. Look at the guys giving him money. Take a look at the guys giving Rubio money. Take a look at the guys giving Cruz money. I'm not even blaming them. It's the system. But when those guys need something, it's 100 percent. Look at the lobbyists, look at the special interests giving these characters money -- 100 percent control over them. They have 100 percent control.

Me? I'm self-funding. I'm not doing the money thing.

(APPLAUSE)

So I'm putting -- you know, I think somebody said to me, I said the other day, how much have I got? I was always proud of the fact -- I think I'm in it for over $25 million already. I didn't have to spend any money. I didn't have to spend any money. But within I'll tell you what, and that's a big thing. I don't think I get credit for that. I'm self-funding my campaign. I'm the only one in either party. I'm self-funding my campaign.

(APPLAUSE)

I'll go a step further. I think I'm the only one in many, many years. I mean I don't remember anybody, maybe Ross Perot many, many years ago, but I don't remember anybody self-funding. They all take money from these people.

And during the debates you probably saw that. Somebody would get up, make a fool out of himself, and they're all standing up clapping like he made a good answer. I'd give a good answer and it was like dead silence in the room.

And I had friends in the room. I said, boy, that's a rich room, because I knew a lot of the guys, lobbyists, special interests. And one of them the other night actually is laughing, having a great time, waving at me. He's a friend of mine, and then booing me when I give an answer. He's boo, boo, boo, and he's like that.

(LAUGHTER)

They're all playing games, folks. In fact I just spoke to him. It's cute, it's fun. It's life. It's the way life is, OK, it's the way life is. But that room, those rooms were packed. They're packed with special interests and they're packed with donors and lobbyists. And those people have total control over the people -

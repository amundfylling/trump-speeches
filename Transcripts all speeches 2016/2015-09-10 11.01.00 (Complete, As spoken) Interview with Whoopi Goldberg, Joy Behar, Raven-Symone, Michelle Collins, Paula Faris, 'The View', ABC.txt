WHOOPI GOLDBERG: REM's "It's The End Of The World As We Know It, " which is a great song and Donald Trump played a, played it at a rally yesterday in DC. And he just became the first Republican candidate to top 30 percent support in the polls and he's joining us on the phone right now. Are you there, Big D?

DONALD TRUMP: I am. Hi, Whoopi. How are you doing?

JOY BEHAR: I guess not.

RAVEN-SYMONE: I heard him. He said, "Hi, Whoopi. How are you doing?"

DONALD TRUMP: I said, I said, how are you doing?

WHOOPI GOLDBERG: I've very well. Now you're in. Hey, now you're in. We can hear you. So let's, we know that you don't have a lot of time. So I'm, I'm gonna kick this off. You know, you were down in Washington. You're very upset about the deal made in Iran. And so I'm gonna ask you about this. What, if, if you're gonna scrap that deal, what's your plan?

DONALD TRUMP: Well, the plan would have been, and I love the concept of a deal because nuclear is nothing but trouble. There's never been anything like it.

RAVEN-SYMONE: That's for sure.

DONALD TRUMP: It's the worst and something should be done.

WHOOPI GOLDBERG: Right.

DONALD TRUMP: Now, we have other places. You look at North Korea and other places, Pakistan...

WHOOPI GOLDBERG: But, but, Donald, we only got you for a couple of minutes.

DONALD TRUMP: I know.

WHOOPI GOLDBERG: So I'm just asking, what's your plan?

DONALD TRUMP: But my, my plan would have been to increase the sanctions substantially and make a much, much better deal. We do not have a good deal. It's a great deal for Iran, but it's not a good deal for us. It's a terrible deal. In addition to all the money we're giving, $150 billion, in addition to so many different things, so many elements of the deal, it's going to lead to nuclear proliferation and it's a very bad deal for us and it's a very bad deal for Israel.

JOY BEHAR: All right.

PAULA FARIS: And, and I know, Donald, this is, this is...

RAVEN-SYMONE: I don't know what the answer was, Donald. I didn't understand the answer. I'm sorry.

PAULA FARIS: This is, this is Paula Faris talking right now. I know you also said one of your priorities would be to get those prisoners out. But I wanna go to the recent polling. You were up eight points since August, but your biggest gains have been upon Republican women. You're up 13 points. So my question to you...

DONALD TRUMP: Wow. That's good. I didn't even know that. That's very good.

PAULA FARIS: You didn't know that. A lot of people are gonna...

DONALD TRUMP: That makes me happy.

PAULA FARIS: It makes you happy, but a lot of people are gonna be shocked by these numbers.

JOY BEHAR: But that doesn't include Megyn Kelly, Donald.

DONALD TRUMP: Well, that, probably, that's true. You know, the, the interesting thing, my daughter, Ivanka, and wife, they say, you know, you should speak more about women's health issues, because they know how strongly and committed I am to it. And Jeb Bush and, and to a large extent, Hillary, are not committed like I'm committed. And they say you really, Ivanka came up to me...

RAVEN-SYMONE: That's, but you...

DONALD TRUMP: ... just today, she said...

JOY BEHAR: No. Hillary's very committed to health issues. She has her whole career, Donald. Come on.

DONALD TRUMP: Well, she said, speak about women's, OK, speak about women's health issues, 'cause I've been very, very committed to it and to me it's very important. And I did notice that in all of the polls, and most of the recent polls, I'm doing really well with women and, which is good. Of course, I'm doing really well overall. But the other one that just came out, and it came out yesterday in a poll, with African-Americans I have 25 percent, which is the highest...

PAULA FARIS: Whoopi.

DONALD TRUMP: ... which is the highest number that they've ever had for a Republican candidate in a primary, which I'm really honored by.

RAVEN-SYMONE: Why do I feel like, but, Donald, I have a question. Why do you always slip up with your words when it comes to women? I feel like there's been a lot of stuff in the, I mean, in the news where you slip up with your words when you're talking about women, but then you say there's so many women on your jock. I'm confused.

DONALD TRUMP: Right. I understand. And don't forget, to a large extent, much of what you've seen is as an entertainer. Because, you know, I had The Apprentice, which was a tremendously successful show.

MICHELLE COLLINS: It was a great show. I've got to say.

DONALD TRUMP: And there's one thing having to do...

RAVEN-SYMONE: You never had me on it. So...

MICHELLE COLLINS: Yeah, well, I'm sad it's gone. Donald, I was hoping to get on. Right? What happened?

JOY BEHAR: So, but, you know, just to follow up on that, let, let, now, don't hang up when I do this. When, 'cause you talked about Carla Fiorina in "Rolling Stone " magazine.

DONALD TRUMP: Right.

JOY BEHAR: And you said look at that face, would anyone vote for that, can you imagine that the face of our next president. Are you making fun of her looks, Donald? 'Cause I know you don't like it...

DONALD TRUMP: Not at all. No. I'm talking about the persona, Joy. This is Joy?

JOY BEHAR: Yeah, it's me.

DONALD TRUMP: Good. Good to have you back, Joy.

JOY BEHAR: Yes. Thank you, Donald.

DONALD TRUMP: I can't see you. It's so good to have you back where you belong. This is where you belong. That's great. But, and, and I'll get over there soon and we'll have to do the show that way.

JOY BEHAR: Yeah, come live so we can look at, yeah.

DONALD TRUMP: But, I, I will say, I will say this. Look, I'm talking about her persona. She failed miserably at Hewlett Packard, she failed at, at Lucent. She was, before that she was at Lucent. She then ran for the Senate. She lost in a landslide.

JOY BEHAR: All right.

DONALD TRUMP: Now she's running for president. I'm talking about her persona. She's got the wrong, we need somebody...

JOY BEHAR: Well, then why don't you talk about her brain instead of her face?

DONALD TRUMP: We need somebody that's, I, I've made a tremendous fortune.

JOY BEHAR: Don't clap.

DONALD TRUMP: We need people that can change our country. Our country is being beaten at every single stage, including foreign trade. (INAUDIBLE).

MICHELLE COLLINS: Donald, I have a question for you.

DONALD TRUMP: Yes?

MICHELLE COLLINS: Kanye West just talked about running for president. Would you ever go on a Trump/Kanye ticket? Is that something you would ever consider doing? 'Cause I think people would be interested.

DONALD TRUMP: Well, it's certainly interesting. You know the thing, the thing I like most about Kanye West? He always speaks so nicely about me. He says the nicest things. So I'll never hit anybody that frankly speaks nicely about me. I can't do that.

JOY BEHAR: But God help them if they do.

PAULA FARIS: I have, I have, Mr. Trump, I have to ask you because right now, the majority of the support with Republicans is going to you and it's also going to Ben Carson. You guys represent 51 percent as of the newest polls. It seems like the gloves have come off. They asked to, they asked him to differentiate himself between the, the two of you. And he says in comparison, I don't deny my faith in God. Have the gloves come off between you and Ben Carson?

DONALD TRUMP: Well, I think so. I think he started it. So remember I like to finish it. It's happened five times now. And every one of those people went down. He talked about my faith. He doesn't know me. I hardly know this guy other than he goes to my club in Palm Beach. I mean, I literally, hardly know him.

MICHELLE COLLINS: That's makes you one of the people, by the way. We've all been to that club, no? (INAUDIBLE) Palm Beach, no?

DONALD TRUMP: And he's telling me about faith. But, but in all, but, you know, in all fairness, I don't know so much about his, his faith. All of a sudden he became a man of great faith. I didn't notice this four, five years ago. And frankly...

WHOOPI GOLDBERG: Well, just, Donald, just, just, just so you...

DONALD TRUMP: ... he, he should not be questioning somebody else's faith when he knows nothing about that person. Because I really don't know Ben Carson and he certainly doesn't know me. And I'm killing him...

WHOOPI GOLDBERG: OK. Well, to, to take this...

DONALD TRUMP: And by the way, I'm killing him in all the polls.

WHOOPI GOLDBERG: ... to take this to another, to take this, just exactly what you're saying, to a sort of different level because, you know, your stance on immigration is, is a little testy for folks, I think. And you're married to a woman who is an immigrant.

DONALD TRUMP: True.

WHOOPI GOLDBERG: You know lots of folks. Your parents, I believe, aren't Native American so they were probably immigrants as well.

DONALD TRUMP: That's true.

JOY BEHAR: And Ivana, too.

WHOOPI GOLDBERG: And, and Ivana. And, and so what is the, what is, what is it you're actually trying to say? Are you, are you saying that all illegal immigrants, not just Mexican?

DONALD TRUMP: Yes. Illegals.

WHOOPI GOLDBERG: But wait, wait, wait. Not just Mexicans, all illegal immigrants?

DONALD TRUMP: Oh, of course not. No, no. Not Mexicans. From all over the world, including people coming in, we have people coming from parts of the world that nobody even believes. I'm saying illegal immigration is a tremendous problem in this country and I want them out. I also feel we have to have a border. We have to create a border. We're a land of laws and we have to create a border. Right now thousands of people a week are pouring through our borders. They're pouring through.

WHOOPI GOLDBERG: Now, are you talking about the Canadians?

DONALD TRUMP: And we can't have that. And you see the (INAUDIBLE).

WHOOPI GOLDBERG: Are you talking about the Canadians?

JOY BEHAR: But you know what? I heard...

WHOOPI GOLDBERG: Are you talking, are you...

DONALD TRUMP: No. I'm talking about right now...

MICHELLE COLLINS: What about if they look like models? Donald, what about the illegal model immigrants? Are they allowed in?

DONALD TRUMP: ... I am talking about our southern, I'm talking about our southern border. We have thousands of people pouring through. We can't do that. And by the way, with that comes tremendous crime. And as you remember, when I first announced, a lot of people hit me on that. Now they're all admitting that I was right. Illegal immigration is a huge problem.

WHOOPI GOLDBERG: No. Yeah, well, Donald...

RAVEN-SYMONE: It was the way you said it. It was the way you said it.

WHOOPI GOLDBERG: I'm sorry, Donald. I, I just wanna, I just wanna be clear.

DONALD TRUMP: Yes.

WHOOPI GOLDBERG: Because not all Mexican immigrants are murderers and rapists. I just want to straighten that up. And, and I think, and I think...

DONALD TRUMP: 100 percent. 100 percent. And, and, Whoopi, I have great relationships with people from Mexico, with Hispanics. And by the way, I came in number one in the Hispanic poll last week.

MICHELLE COLLINS: What poll? What poll (INAUDIBLE)?

WHOOPI GOLDBERG: That, I'm, I'm, you know, I'm in a lot of polls myself. But my question, but I just want to make sure, I just want to make sure that when you're talking about illegal immigration, you are including all of the folks who are here illegally. And the best way, in your mind, to get people to not be illegal anymore is to throw everybody out? How will you find everybody?

DONALD TRUMP: Well, the people have to go, what I'm saying is people have to go through a process. And we can even expedite the process. But we have to go through a process to become legal and be in this country. I want to have people come into the country, but they have to come in legally. And if they don't come in legally, that's not good.

JOY BEHAR: OK.

RAVEN-SYMONE: What about the immigrants that are already here? Can they work towards it?

JOY BEHAR: I have another question.

PAULA FARIS: There's a pathway for citizenship.

JOY BEHAR: You know, a lot of people, Donald, think that you're still a Democrat. And I'm very interested in that part of you. Because a lot of what you say I think is correct. You wanna tax hedge funders.

DONALD TRUMP: (INAUDIBLE).

JOY BEHAR: You're not tearing up the Iranian deal like some of your cohorts, Rubio and the rest of them. You also are very sort of receptive to Syrian refugees coming to this country, which I think shows that you have a heart. Are you a Democrat, really at heart? What's his name, Donald?

MICHELLE COLLINS: Donald.

JOY BEHAR: Donald. I'm so used to calling you The Donald that I got... Tell me.

DONALD TRUMP: Well, look, I do have a very big heart and I want to take care of people. And that's a very important part of leading, especially when you're talking about leading the country. I used to be a Democrat and Ronald Reagan used to be a Democrat and he switched and I switched years ago. And now I'm a Republican, I'm a conservative Republican, but with a very big heart. We have to take care of people. Whether it's on women's health issues or so many other issues, we have to take care of people. And I think that last issue is one of the reasons that everybody says, and I mean, you informed me today, but I'm leading everywhere. I'm leading with women. I'm leading with evangelicals.

MICHELLE COLLINS: Donald, what do you wanna say to women? What's your message?

DONALD TRUMP: I wanna say that I cherish women and I will protect women and I will take care of women and I have great respect for women.

JOY BEHAR: So you're not against defunding Planned Parenthood, am I hearing that?

DONALD TRUMP: I, I am against abortion. And they are...

JOY BEHAR: Three percent, wait a second.

DONALD TRUMP: That's a tremendous, that is, Joy, that is a tremendous amount of the work they do.

JOY BEHAR: No. It's three percent.

RAVEN-SYMONE: No, it's not. It's not.

WHOOPI GOLDBERG: No, it's not. You've got, Donald, the thing that, that we want you to do, as we, as we go into the rest of this run...

DONALD TRUMP: Right.

WHOOPI GOLDBERG: ... is you gotta get a little bit more informed on what's going on in women's issues. It's just, and I don't say this with disrespect at all. I'm not saying this disrespectfully.

DONALD TRUMP: Well, I understand that, but I, I do think, I do think I am very well informed. But (INAUDIBLE) if you look at it...

WHOOPI GOLDBERG: No. Baby, you're, I, I swear to you, we, I, I swear to you, Donald, you're misinformed here.

JOY BEHAR: But let me tell him what it is. Planned Parenthood does abortions for three percent of the people who come to them. The rest, wait, the rest is women's health. OK. And that three percent is not federally funded. So nobody's tax money is being used for abortions. And yet, if you defund Planned Parenthood, millions of women will not get health care.

WHOOPI GOLDBERG: Millions.

JOY BEHAR: I think, since you've shown to have such a big heart for the Syrians, you might want to extend that to women in this country.

DONALD TRUMP: Well, you know, Joy, I'll tell you what. You know, you said three percent. But as you know, the numbers are 55 and 60 and 65 percent of the money. And what we're saying...

JOY BEHAR: No.

WHOOPI GOLDBERG: No. Donald, you know what, when you come here, we will, it'll be so much easier...

DONALD TRUMP: OK. We will...

WHOOPI GOLDBERG: ... 'cause we have to go.

DONALD TRUMP: We will talk about it.

WHOOPI GOLDBERG: But we love you, we wanted, we have to go to break. We want you to...

JOY BEHAR: Come.

WHOOPI GOLDBERG: ... come here.

PAULA FARIS: Come to the table. Come to the table, Donald.

RAVEN-SYMONE: Come sit right here.

DONALD TRUMP: I will be there.

WHOOPI GOLDBERG: We'll have some snacks and stuff. Maybe a little wine.

DONALD TRUMP: OK. You have a deal.

WHOOPI GOLDBERG: Thank you for talking to us.

JOY BEHAR: We'll have some tacos.

DONALD TRUMP: I look forward to it. Thank you very much.

WHOOPI GOLDBERG: We'll be right back. Thanks, Donald Trump.

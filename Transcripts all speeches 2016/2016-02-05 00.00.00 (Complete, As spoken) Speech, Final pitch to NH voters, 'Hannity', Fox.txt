DONALD TRUMP: My theme is "Make America Great Again." We're losing with China, with Mexico, with Japan on trade. Everybody's beating us. Billions and billions of dollars is gone. We have people that don't know what they're doing. We have a president that doesn't know what he's doing. Our military is being depleted. Our veterans aren't taken care of. Our borders are open and people are pouring through like water. We can't continue to do things like this. Obamacare is a disaster. It's got to be repealed and replaced. I'll do that immediately. We have to preserve our Second Amendment. We have to get rid of Common Core. There's so many things to do, but we're going to do them. If I'm president, we will, indeed, make America great again.

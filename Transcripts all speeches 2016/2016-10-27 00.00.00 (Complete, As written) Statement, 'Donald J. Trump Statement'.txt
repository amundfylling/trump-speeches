DONALD TRUMP: The more emails WikiLeaks releases, the more the lines between the Clinton Foundation, the Secretary of State's office, and the Clintons' personal finances are blurred. Just today we read about Clinton confidant Doug Band bragging that he had funneled tens of millions of dollars to "Bill Clinton, Inc." through the foundation donations, paid speeches and consulting contracts.

Mr. Band called the arrangement "unorthodox." The rest of us call it outright corruption. In fact, the Clinton Foundation even hired a law firm to find out if their pay to play scheme would jeopardize their charitable status with the IRS. If the Clintons were willing to play this fast and loose with their enterprise when they weren't in the White House, just imagine what they will do if they are given the chance to control the Oval Office.

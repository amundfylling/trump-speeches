KASIE HUNT: you accuse him of being?

DONALD TRUMP: No, it's not that. He has to go out and do his thing. He's a 3 and poll just came out, I'm 42. So I think I do the exact same thing.

I thought it was a little unfair that CNN was leading him along, the last question where they led him along, Mr. Trump said. But, I really enjoyed this evening. I think Jeb tried very hard. He's having a hard time, let's face it.

KASIE HUNT: Senator Cruz didn't follow through with any attacks on you tonight, and you seemed to back off some of your earlier criticism. Are you --

DONALD TRUMP: No, I get along great with him. I mean, he's been backing me all along, he's been really the one person that backed me with virtually everything, and we have a very good relationship. And I was very happy to see that he backed off his statement that he made, you know, in the closed doors. I respect him for it. I have a lot of respect for him, he's a good guy.

KASIE HUNT: You did call him a maniac. You're not going to do that again?

DONALD TRUMP: Yes, but you know what? Time goes by.

DONALD TRUMP: We are going to bring Buffalo back! We're going to bring New York back! And we're going to bring the United States of America back!

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

And we love this state and we love New York values! Do we agree? We love New York values.

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

Do not get discouraged. I'm telling you. I'm bringing it back fast. You watch what happens. We're not making bad trade deals. We're going to end all the nonsense and we're going to bring jobs back to the United States, and that includes Buffalo. That includes Buffalo.

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

Every single country, no matter what, you can look at everyone, you can call out a name -- every single country that we do business with, we end up with the short end of the stick, and it's going to end here! It's going to end! We're bringing our jobs back here!

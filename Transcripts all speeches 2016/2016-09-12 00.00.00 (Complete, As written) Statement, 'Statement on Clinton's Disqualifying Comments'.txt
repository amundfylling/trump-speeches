MICHAEL FLYNN: Hillary Clinton Can't Be Trusted To Serve The Best Interests Of All The American People If She's Willing To Display This Much Contempt For Their Existence.

Hillary Clinton's comments that half of Donald Trump's supporters are 'deplorable' are personally insulting, and should serve as wake up call to the American people. As commander-in-chief, it's the president's responsibility to look out for and represent our nation's armed forces. Hillary Clinton can't be trusted to serve the best interests of all the American people if she's willing to display this much contempt for their existence. This is just another item in a long list of scandals and lies that disqualify Hillary Clinton from being our president.

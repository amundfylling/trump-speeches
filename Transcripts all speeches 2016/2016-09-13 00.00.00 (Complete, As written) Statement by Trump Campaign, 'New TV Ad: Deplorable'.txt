TRUMP CAMPAIGN: Today Donald J. Trump for President released a new television ad entitled "Deplorable" revealing Hillary Clinton's true nature and exposing her contempt for everyday Americans. This ad will air in the battleground states of Ohio, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, and Florida.

JASON MILLER: 'Deplorable' is a response to the incredibly offensive comments Hillary Clinton made last Friday in front of reporters and her wealthy donor friends, and serves as a call to action for the tens of millions of hard working Americans she viciously demonized -- to stand united against the Clinton-led rigged Washington system. These highly offensive and divisive comments reveal the contempt and disgust for everyday Americans that Hillary Clinton has hoped to hide by avoiding the press and running the least-transparent campaign in modern political history."

VOICEOVER: Speaking to wealthy donors Hillary Clinton called tens of millions of Americans "Deplorable."

HILLARY CLINTON: "You could put half of Trump's supporters into what I call the 'Basket of Deplorables.' The racists, sexists, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic, you name it."

VOICEOVER: People like you... you... and you. "Deplorable." You know what's deplorable? Hillary Clinton viciously demonizing hard working people like you.

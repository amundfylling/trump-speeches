MIKE PENCE: I'm a Christian, a conservative, and a Republican, in that order.

(APPLAUSE)

And I've got to tell you, I joined this campaign in a heartbeat, because you have nominated a man for president who never quits.

(APPLAUSE)

Who never backs down. He is a fighter. He is a winner. And until very recently, it seemed like he was out there fighting all on his own, but now this movement is coming together. Ohio is coming together, and we're going to make Donald Trump the next president of the United States of America.

(APPLAUSE)

You know, I truly do believe Donald Trump literally embodies the spirit of America, strong, freedom-loving, independent, optimistic, and willing to fight every day for what he believes in and for what makes America great.

(APPLAUSE)

You sure saw that the other night in Las Vegas, didn't you, when he beat Hillary Clinton in that third debate hands down.

(APPLAUSE)

Kind of fun to watch. I've got to tell you, we had a little bit of a debate of our own not too long, over in Farmville, Virginia, in the vice-presidential contest, and some people think that I won that debate.

(APPLAUSE)

Thank you. Thank you. I'm humbled by that, but I've got to tell you, from where I was sitting, Donald Trump won that debate. Donald Trump's leadership won that debate, and Donald Trump's vision to make America great again is going to win all the way to the White House.

(APPLAUSE)

You know, because the truth is this isn't really -- this election isn't really just a choice between two people. It's really a choice between two futures. So let me trilateral you where I stand. I choose the stronger America. I choose a more prosperous America. I choose an America that cherishes our highest Constitutional traditions, so I choose to stand with Donald Trump and every American who knows we can make America great again.

(APPLAUSE)

You know, and it's not like it's exactly a fair fight out there. I mean, I get up every morning. I'm not going to turn on the television with a stick. You know what I'm talking about? I mean, I -- almost (INAUDIBLE) know what's going to be on there. It's like -- the media is like two on one with the national media doing half of Hillary Clinton's work for her every day. But remarkably, Donald Trump is still winning hearts and minds all across Ohio and all across America. And he's going to win all the way to the White House.

(APPLAUSE)

But the media bias is really unambiguous. I just saw a study today. I don't know if you heard about it. Media Research Center says in the 12 weeks since the national conventions, Donald Trump has received a majority of the coverage. And 91 percent of it has been negative. I think, how did they miss that other 9 percent? I mean, really and truly.

And it's not just the media bias and the one thing after another, going after -- and you know, then they got a sentence out there. They got tweet out there. They got something he said, something he didn't say. I mean, it's kind of funny to watch them.

The media will only -- you know, now they think they've finally got him. Right? Now they finally did him in. And then you turn on the television the next morning and Donald Trump is still standing stronger than ever before and fighting for the American people.

(APPLAUSE)

You know, the truth of the matter is, when I think about all those pundits and all those talking heads on television, you know, I just think it's emblematic of the time that we have. And we see this movement welling up across Ohio and across the countries. Because when I think of these times, I just -- the American people are just tired of being told. You with me on that?

\(UNKNOWN\): Yes.

I mean, we're just tired of being told this is as good as it gets. You know, we're tired of being told, frankly, by people in both political parties, that they'll get around to solving those problems eventually, just not now. And we're tired of being told, like Ronald Reagan said so many years ago, that a little intellectual elite in a far distant capitol can plan our lives better for us that we can plan them for ourselves.

The American people are tired of being told. And when Donald Trump becomes president of the United States of America, he's going to be a champion for the American people, and he's going to tell Washington D.C., and tell the political class how it's going to be.

(APPLAUSE)

But I've got to tell you, folks, I see -- you see the media out there working this thing up? Hillary Clinton's out there acting like she's got this whole thing in the bag. (INAUDIBLE.) You're hearing those stories. She's out there like they got this whole thing rolled up, but don't be fooled. The race is on, and we're going to fight all the way to a victory come Election Day.

(APPLAUSE)

She may have the media. She may have the media, the money, and the special interests, but I'll tell you what I just got asked by Brian Williams on his TV show for tonight. He says, "What's your firewall?" I said, "Our firewall is the American people."

(APPLAUSE)

And the American people are going to make America great again.

You know, and it really is -- it's not just what they're doing talking about my running mate, but it's what they're not talking about, right? I mean, Hillary Clinton, good heavens. I mean, you got -- when she's Secretary of State -- stay with me, kids.

When you're Secretary of State, you're in charge of all the foreign policy of the United States of America. They have a private foundation that takes money from foreign governments, while she's Secretary of State. And then you have this private email server that -- in between all that, so it's not subject to public disclosure, to see what was going on. And when it becomes public that she had a private server, she used high technology and hammers to try and keep the emails out of public reach.

But, you know, truth -- truth is a force of nature and things are coming out. Things are coming out. We just found out in the last week that the FBI confirmed that the State Department under Hillary Clinton offered a quid pro quo, quid pro quo to the FBI if they let them change the classification status on emails on that private server.

And then we just found out that, while the State Department was passing out contracts to rebuild Haiti after that terrible earthquake in 2010, one of her senior aides at the State Department said, "Just make sure we flag" -- they said, "You should flag Friends of the Clintons for contracts to rebuild Haiti."

You know, the American people are tired, sick and tired of pay- to-play politics, and it's exactly the kind of politics that's going to come to a crashing halt when Donald Trump becomes president of the United States.

(APPLAUSE)

When Donald Trump becomes president, his only special interest is going to be you, the American people. And Donald Trump has a plan. It's a five-point plan to bring honesty, accountability, and real change to Washington, D.C. It's a 100-day action plan, and Donald Trump's going to -- how about this? We're like, members of Congress, you're not going to be able to go lobby for five years.

And here's an idea. How about, registered foreign agents cannot raise money in American political campaigns anymore.

(APPLAUSE)

There's a good idea. Donald Trump's got a plan. When we re- elect these Republican majorities in the House and Senate, we're going to pass it into law and Donald Trump is going to drain the swamp in Washington, D.C.

(APPLAUSE)

You know, actually he's got a broad plan. We're calling it the Contract with the American Voter. And the man that wrote The Art of the Deal's got a real deal for the American people. I encourage you to look at it. And it's such a contrast between our plan and her failed record. This really couldn't be more dramatic. So we need to talk about that.

Because despite what they're not talking about, or what they are talking about, this election, I truly do believe, is about security. It's about prosperity, and it's about the Supreme Court of the United States of America.

(APPLAUSE)

And we've got to tell our neighbors and friends about that. And you've got to leave here tonight and you've got to tell people about that in the days ahead.

On the security front, you know, here it is. Despite traveling millions of miles as our Secretary of State, there's no question the world is a more dangerous place today than the day that Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama took over foreign policy.

(APPLAUSE)

Our allies are less secure. Our enemies are more emboldened. In seven and a half years of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton foreign policy's weakened America's place in the world, and set entire areas in the wider Middle East virtually spinning apart.

You know, history teaches that weakness arouses evil. And a weak and apologetic foreign policy, designed by Hillary Clinton, of this administration, of leading from behind, moving red lines, feigning (PH) resets with Russia, and paying ransom to terrorist-sponsoring states is emblematic of a weak and feckless foreign policy.

Let me make you a promise. Let me make you a promise. When Donald Trump is president of the United States of American, we won't be paying ransom to terrorist-sponsoring states. They'll be paying a price.

(APPLAUSE)

Now, just remember, it was Hillary Clinton who initiated that disastrous agreement with the radical mullahs in Iran to begin with. They got $150 billion and all we got was a delay in the leading state- sponsor of terrorism obtaining the most powerful weapons on earth. It was Hillary Clinton, as Secretary of State -- don't miss this. It was Hillary Clinton as Secretary of State who failed to negotiate an agreement with the sovereign government of Iraq that would have allowed us to keep American forces past 2012 in that country.

Now, let's remember a little bit of history here. I remember those days. I was in the Congress of the United States during the -- as we watched the difficult days of the war, the incredible sacrifices of our soldiers. I watched the surge. A commander-in-chief in our last....

(AUDIO GAP)

... worn the uniform of the United States in recent years and in the distant past.

Would you mind sliding your hand in the air and just letting us show our appreciation one more time?

(APPLAUSE)

When I think of the service and the sacrifice of our brave servicemen and women like those that are gathered here, I'm deeply humbled. But it breaks my heart to think that under this administration Bill Clinton and Barack Obama had all American forces come out of Iraq. They created the very vacuum in which the barbarous terrorist organization ISIS was able to be conjured up out of the desert to overrun vast areas of Iraq that the American soldier had already won.

And as we stand here today, let's remember in our prayers that at this moment, there's more than 5,000special forces having to go back and win back what the American soldier had already won.

And lastly, it saw Hillary Clinton and her State Department who left Americans in harm's way in Benghazi. And after four Americans fell, after four Americans fell, she told the families of the fallen that it was because of a film-maker in the United States, even though the night of the attack she told her own daughter in an email that it was a terrorist-style al-Qaeda attack.

When she was asked by the United States Senate -- when she was asked before the Senate about that contradiction of facts, she said words that just grieved my heart. She said, quote, "What difference, at this point, does it make?"

\(UNKNOWN\): Boo.

Let me tell you, as the proud father of a United States Marine, anybody who said that, anybody who did that, should be disqualified from ever serving as commander-in-chief of the armed forces of the United States of America. You don't leave American soldiers in harm's way. And you don't say, "What difference does it make" when they fall.

(APPLAUSE) It hasn't just been the lack of leadership, though, but it's been the policies that Hillary Clinton wants to continue. We have the lowest troop levels in the U.S. Army since 1940, the smallest Navy since 1916. And last year we bought fewer aircraft for our aging Air Force than any year since 1934.

We cannot have four more years of apologizing to our enemies, abandoning our friends, and failing to invest in the arsenal of democracy. Men and women, for America to be safe, for the world to be safe, America needs to be strong. And Donald Trump will lead on the world stage with American strength.

(APPLAUSE)

We will again have peace through strength. We will rebuild our military. We will restore the arsenal of democracy. We will give our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines the resources and support they need to accomplish their mission, and they will hunt down ISIS and destroy it at its source.

(APPLAUSE)

You know, that's probably why today more than 200 retired admirals and generals, including more than 20 Medal of Honor winners, have endorsed Donald Trump to be the next commander-in-chief of the United States.

(APPLAUSE)

You know, it's not just security at home. It's about safety. It's about safety in our streets here in Ohio, and our communities. And, you know, let me just say, you know, my uncle was a cop. One of my heroes. When I was a little boy, we used to go up and visit our family in Chicago, and my brothers and I would just marvel when our uncle would come walking out of his room wearing that uniform with his sidearm, ready to go to work on the streets, and down in the Loop.

Now, this is a very challenging time for men and women who wear the uniform of law enforcement. Too often these days, too often when there's a tragedy in the wake of law enforcement officers doing their duty, instead of just investigating it in a transparent way as the public always requires, there's too many on the American left and the American media who are more than willing to use a broad brush to demean all law enforcement, as a force for division in our country.

Now, Donald Trump and I believe the men and women who serve on the thin blue line of law enforcement are not a force for division in America. They are a force for good. They are the best of us.

(APPLAUSE)

You know, there's a lot of peace officers who are here with us today. Would you mind just showing how much you appreciate this law enforcement community here in Ohio?

(APPLAUSE) I'm going to make you a promise. When he becomes the chief law enforcement officer of the United States, a president Donald Trump will stand with the men and women in law enforcement at every level. We will provide the resources and the training for them to protect our families and go home safe to theirs. And we will restore law and order to every community and every city in this land.

(APPLAUSE)

Hillary Clinton advocates open borders. Donald Trump will end illegal immigration once and for all, and remove dangerous criminal aliens from our country. While Hillary Clinton wants to increase Syrian refugees to this country, even though our security officials say we can't know who they are for sure, Donald Trump and I will immediately suspend any immigration from countries that have been compromised by terror.

(APPLAUSE)

In a word, Donald Trump will uphold law and order in this nation, and put the safety and security of the American people first. That's probably why the 330,000 members of the Fraternal Order of Police nationwide endorsed Donald Trump to be the next president of the United States.

(APPLAUSE)

You know, but it's not just about security abroad and safety at home. It's also about prosperity. And I promise you that any progress you've made here in Ohio, and progress we've made over in the Hoosier State, is in spite of what's been coming out of Washington, D.C., not because of it.

In fact, more often than not, the hardships that we're facing are because of exactly what's been rolling out of our nation's capital. We're in the weakest economic recovery since the Great Depression.

Nearly one in four Americans in their prime earning years isn't even working today. One in four. One in five households has no one with a job. There are 45 million Americans on food stamps and 47 million Americans living below the poverty line. Millions more than when Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton began this last administration together.

Hillary Clinton's plan? More of the same. More of the same failed ideas. Trillion dollar tax increase, trillion dollars in spending, more regulation, more Obamacare and more of the war on American energy that is stifling American jobs.

(APPLAUSE)

You know, the truth is they tell us this economy is the best that we can do. And I think the people of Marietta know better. It's not the best that we can do. It's just the best they can do. And when Donald Trump becomes president of the United States of American, we're going to put common sense conservative principles into practice, and we're going to get this economy working again.

(APPLAUSE)

Because Donald Trump's got a plan. Donald Trump's got a plan. We're going to work with a rreelected Republican majority in the House and Senate. How about Congressman Bill Johnson, everybody? Isn't he strong as a new rope?

(APPLAUSE)

We're going to rreelect Congressman Bill Johnson. We're going to rreelect majorities in the House. You're going to rreelect Senator Rob Portman from the great state of Ohio, and we're going to work with that Congress. We're going to cut taxes across the board for working families, small businesses, and family farms. We're going to do away with death taxes once and for all, and we're going to lower business taxes in America so companies in Ohio can create jobs in Ohio and not see them go overseas.

(APPLAUSE)

And because regulation is a form of taxation, Donald Trump -- Donald Trump's going to have a moratorium on a new federal red tape, and we're going to repeal every single unconstitutional Obama executive order on day one.

(APPLAUSE)

And with Donald Trump becomes negotiator in chief -- you with me on this one? But I mean we -- look, we know that trade means jobs, right? I mean, what we make and what we grow here in Ohio we sell around the world. That supports jobs. Low-cost imports support low- cost goods here in the United States. But when Donald Trump becomes president of the United States, trade is going to mean jobs, but trade is going to mean American jobs first.

We're going to renegotiate NAFTA. We're going to get out of this Transpacific deal, and we're going to negotiate trade agreements that work for the American worker first.

(APPLAUSE)

And two more things, I've got to tell you what. It really is amazing to me to be standing in this great community, in this great part of Ohio, and know that we're actually running against somebody who said back in March, quote, "Elect her president." She said, quote, "We're going to put a lot of coal miners and a lot of coal companies out of business." She said that.

Well, Hillary, no, you're not.

(APPLAUSE)

Trump digs coal, and the war on coal is going to come to a crashing halt when Donald Trump becomes president of the United States. We're going to develop an all-of-the-above energy strategy that calls for all of the resources of our land to drive an American renewal.

And lastly -- and lastly, when Donald Trump becomes president of the United States, we're going to do something about what president -- former President Bill Clinton called the craziest thing in the world.

(LAUGHTER)

Did you hear about that?

\(UNKNOWN\): Yes.

I mean, President Clinton, he was back at it today. He was complaining about the copays, the deductibles. He said the premiums are too high.

I mean, I remember back when we were fighting against Obamacare on Capital Hill. I was a member of Congress at the time, and Nancy Pelosi actually said, "We've got to pass this bill, so we can find out what's in it."

(LAUGHTER)

Do you remember that? Well, we found out. And even Bill Clinton doesn't like it. I mean, the truth of -- I mean, the reality is even with the Clintons, sometimes truth happens.

(LAUGHTER)

But that's not the best of it. Did you hear what President Obama said about this whole thing last week? It was like the third anniversary of the rollout of Obamacare. You're going to think I'm making this up. I'm not. President Obama last week actually literally compared Obamacare to the Samsung Galaxy 7 phones which have been known to spontaneously burst into flames.

(LAUGHTER)

It's true. Now, listen. Listen to this quote. Listen to this quote. He said, quote, "When one of these companies comes out with a new smartphone and it has a few bugs, what do they do? They fix it. They upgrade it. Unless it catches fire. Then they pull it off the market."

(LAUGHTER)

Well, what a coincidence, Mr. President, because that's exactly what we're going to do with Obamacare. We're going to pull it off the market.

(APPLAUSE)

We're going to repeal Obamacare, and we're going to replace it with healthcare reform that lowers the cost of health insurance without growing the size of government and raising taxes. We're going to meet it not with the socialized medicine that Hillary Clinton longs for out of Canada, but we're going to do it with free market economics and more consumer choice. That's the American way.

(APPLAUSE)

So it's about security at home and abroad. It's about prosperity, prosperity of this generation and the next.

But also, lastly, and maybe more -- most significantly, you need to think long and hard about this. We're going to elect a president for a four-year term. But that president is probably going to set the course and direction of the Supreme Court of the United States for the next 40 years.

With the passing of the late Justice Antonin Scalia, literally the balance of the Court is on the ballot, but there could be two and maybe three more retirements for the Court.

I mean, if you cherish the Constitution, if you cherish limited government, if you cherish the Second Amendment to the Constitution of the United States,...

(APPLAUSE)

... if you cherish all our God-given liberties and you cherish the sanctity of life, you just need to think long and hard about that.

\(UNKNOWN\): Yes.

I mean, did you hear Hillary Clinton in that debate the other night? She got a question. She got a question about the Supreme Court, and she actually said -- it took her about two minutes before she ever mentioned the Constitution. Go back and look. I was right there. I was on the front row. I was like the media (PH).

And I watched the -- my Timex watch. I watched it -- like two minutes before she brought up the Constitution. But what she said was she wanted -- she wanted a Court that represents a certain viewpoint.

Well, let me say, like your Congressman Bill Johnson, I was in the representative branch of government. OK. The Congress represents the people. The president represents all the people. The Supreme Court is supposed to uphold the Constitution of the United States of America, and settle disputes, and uphold the law.

(APPLAUSE)

I mean, so let me just say, for the sake of the rule of law, for the sake of the sanctity of life, and the sake of that Second Amendment, for the sake of all of our God-given liberties that are enshrined in our Bill of Rights, we must decide, Ohio, here and now, that the next president who will make appointments to the Supreme Court of the United States will be president Donald Trump.

(APPLAUSE)

So the choice could not be more clear. The choice could not be more clear, as the evening wends on. I know you guys have got a ball game to watch.

(LAUGHTER)

So do I. Look, it's change versus the status quo. It really -- it's this simple. This is change versus the status quo. And the other side -- the other side says, if you like your status quo, you can keep it.

(LAUGHTER)

And they'll keep this promise. But I truly do believe, I mean, this is the moment where Americans can elect someone who literally personifies the failed status quo in Washington, D.C. Or we can vote for change. We can vote for a leader. We can vote for someone who will stand strong for the American people every single day and restore and make this country great again. That's the choice that we have.

(APPLAUSE)

So I've got three requests for you. I have three things I'd like you to think about doing. And then I'm going to say hello to as many of you as I can, and I'm going to head back to the Hoosier State tonight.

Number one, you know, early voting has already started here in Ohio. So the first thing I want to ask you to do is, don't wait. Vote.

(APPLAUSE)

Just vote. Get it done. Grab a neighbor or friend, a family member, and say, "Let's get in the car. Let's just get over and vote." The Washington County Board of Elections, open Monday through Friday, 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. 204 Davis Avenue, Marietta.

(APPLAUSE)

It's closed for tonight, but it's just one mile away from here. But OK, it's over there? OK, that way? OK.

\(UNKNOWN\): INAUDIBLE.

Just go vote. Just get it out of the way. I mean, really and truly, men and women, I mean, we've got 13 full days in front of us, I think, by the way you reckon it. So I want you to get that out of the way, because I want you to do some other things before we're there. So go vote. Vote early, and bring your friends and your neighbors to do it.

Secondly, if you feel as passionately as I do about this election, if you recognize that this is no ordinary time in the life of our nation, then I want you to go tell somebody in the remaining two weeks of this campaign. Get your own vote out of the way. Make sure your family and your neighbors and your friends vote.

And then what remains in this election, I just want you to go tell somebody. I want you to tell -- tell your neighbors and your friends why you're...

(AUDIO GAP)

... but now. I really do. It's a choice between -- tell your neighbors and friends, "I ran into Mike the other day. We were over at Marietta High School, and Mike, like, talked about it this way." Just tell them this.

This is a choice between whether we're going to continue to go down the hill with failed policies that weakened America's place in the world, hollowed out our military, emboldened our competitors and our adversaries, stifled the American economy in virtually every imaginable way, and walked farther away from our highest ideals and Constitutional traditions, or whether we are going to stop, plant our feet, turn around, and march back up the hill to a stronger America at home and abroad, a more prosperous America, and an America that celebrates and cherishes our highest Constitutional ideals. That's what this is.

So you need to go tell somebody. And when you tell them, I'm going to have a word for you here in Marietta. You know, the truth of the matter is Donald Trump has won over an extraordinary movement of people across this country.

And it's really amazing. I mean, independents all across America who are tired of the gridlock in Washington, D.C., not getting anything done. And they're tired of a politics that benefits the favored few, are being drawn to this campaign.

Many Democrats have been drawn to this campaign, who are tired of these bad trade deals that have seen American jobs leaving Ohio and leaving our country, and leaving Indiana. And they're tired of the liberal policies that are avalanching out of Washington, D.C. So now I would -- and let me speak specifically to those of you that have neighbors and friends in the Republican Party. OK?

I -- now it's time to reach out to our Republican friends, and say with one voice, "It's time to come home."

\(UNKNOWN\): Yes.

(APPLAUSE)

It's time for Republican voters to come home, come home to make the Trump-Pence team victorious on Election Day. Come home to rreelect Republican majorities in the United States House and Senate, and rreelect Senator Rob Portman here in Ohio.

And come home to ensure that Hillary Clinton will never be elected president of the United States of America. It's time to come home.

(APPLAUSE)

I mean, we went through that rough and tumble primary. I think there were like 150 people running in the Republican primary, right? It's hard to get over that sometimes, you know? They say in NASCAR, rubbing is racing. You bang (PH) sometimes INAUDIBLE. It takes a while to bang them out, right?

It's time to come home. This is no time to make a statement. It's time to make a difference. So go tell your Republican friends.

And lastly, I would just say to you, if you're keeping track, vote early. Go tell somebody what the stakes are in this election. And thirdly, have faith. You know? It's time to have faith.

(APPLAUSE)

Have faith in the American people. And have faith in the American people, the ability of the American people. As Donald Trump said so eloquently in Gettysburg, he said, "Our challenge today is we need to, quote, rise about the noise and the clutter of our broken politics, and embrace the great faith and optimism that has always been central to the American character."

Have faith. Have faith in people. Your neighbors and friends can see through it and see beyond it. Walk up to them with confidence. You know, don't hide your light under a bushel basket. Just go tell them why you're wearing that red hat. Tell them why you're wearing that deplorable shirt.

(LAUGHTER)

And just be confident. Be confident, because I truly do believe, and Abraham Lincoln said it well. "Give the people the facts, and the Republic will be saved."

The American people, given the facts, will always choose government as good as our people, and they will always choose freedom and a stronger America. So have faith. Have faith in the American people.

(APPLAUSE)

And lastly, have that other kind of faith as well. You know, this is a very challenging time in the life of our nation. But I've got faith. I've got faith that He who was with our founders from the moment they put a boot on that Plymouth Rock, and every day since, He's still with us today.

(APPLAUSE)

And that if His people, in these divided times in America, I believe with all my heart, which has always been true and is still true today, that if His people who are called by His name will humble themselves and pray, He'll do like He's always done. He'll hear from Heaven, and He'll heal this land, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

(APPLAUSE)

So, men and women of Marietta, Tigers all, we've got our work cut out for us. I want you to use every moment, every moment that you can spare from family and work to talk to your neighbors and friends in the days that remain. And I'll make you a promise. If we do all that we can, I can tell you that man is ready. This team is ready. This movement is ready.

(APPLAUSE)

If you go out and make sure that Ohio is ready, we will make Donald Trump the 45th president of the United States of America, and we will make America great again.

Thank you very much. God bless you, Ohio. Let's go get it done.

DONALD TRUMP: And as much as you want to put them in our jails, they were probably sent here so that we put them in our jails, because to put them in our jails -- they didn't pay the electric bill. To put them -- I like that much better. And because the lights didn't work, I won't pay the rent, so we get better lighting and we don't pay the rent. Right. Right. No, get those lights off. Off. Off. Turn them off. They're too bright. Turn them off. Turn them off.

Let's go, ready. Turn off the lights. Turn off the lights. Turn off the lights. Turn them off.

(CHEERS)

So much nicer.

No, no. That's the way we have to negotiate for our country.

It's the kind of sick thinking we really need for our country, isn't that right? So, because the lights didn't work, even though it's better, we say we're not paying the rent. The lights didn't work. This is ridiculous. We will not pay the rent and we say bye bye.

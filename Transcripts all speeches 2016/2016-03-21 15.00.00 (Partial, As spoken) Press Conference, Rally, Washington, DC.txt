DONALD TRUMP: With that all being said, if you have any questions, please raise your hand.

Yes.

UNIDENTIFIED: (OFF-MIKE)

DONALD TRUMP: That has nothing to do with this, but that's OK. We met with Senator Sessions and some of the great people in Washington. And you pretty much know who was there, I would imagine. And we had a great meeting. We had a really good meeting.

UNIDENTIFIED: (OFF-MIKE)

DONALD TRUMP: Yes. Well, I don't have a list now, but we have various energies. Yes, various senators and congressmen.

We can provide a list for you, if you would like, OK?

UNIDENTIFIED: (OFF-MIKE)

DONALD TRUMP: No, not at all. No, not at all. We're very inclusive.

Frankly, Jeff and some of the other people just invited a small group. And we're doing very well. It looks like we're doing very well in Arizona and very well pretty much everyplace else. And I think we're going to maybe easily that number of the 1,237.

We should make it pretty easily, based on what I'm seeing. So we won't have to worry about fighting at a convention.

Yes.

UNIDENTIFIED: (OFF-MIKE)

DONALD TRUMP: Well, I think I'm very different from Hillary Clinton, to put it mildly.

I think we have a very different style. I don't think she will be one that's going to do much with our trade agreements, which are killing our country. People have no idea how important that is. The money that is being drained out of our country is enormous. And that's not her thing. It's totally my thing.

I think she will be very, very weak on the military. I think she will be very weak with other -- frankly, with other countries and the amount of money we subsidize them without...

(BREAK)

... solvent. And we have to make our country, frankly, rich if we're going to save all these things. And we have to rebuild our military. It's been in very bad shape. It's decimated, just decimated over a period of years.

And we have got to get the right equipment, not the wrong equipment. We have got to get equipment that isn't there because of political experience and political know-how. We want to get the equipment they really want, not the equipment that they're getting because politicians have access to certain companies.

And we're going to rebuild our military. And I think that's going to be a big difference also.

UNIDENTIFIED: (OFF-MIKE)

DONALD TRUMP: Well, she doesn't know anything about my policy. She wouldn't know anybody about it.

Her policies obviously didn't work. All you have to do is look at Libya. Look at anything you want to look at. And they haven't worked. And I think if you look back at my projections and my prognostications, they turn out to be very, very accurate. Sir.

UNIDENTIFIED: (OFF-MIKE)

DONALD TRUMP: Well, I'm going to make a speech about two hours, so...

UNIDENTIFIED: (OFF-MIKE)

DONALD TRUMP: Well, I also said -- no, I said I what I said.

Remember, I said that I want to look into it. I want to speak to governmental people in Israel and here. I want to speak to various senators and various people, including Senator Jeff Sessions, who's highly -- Jeff is highly respected. And actually Ted Cruz I think respected him more than any senator. And he thought he was going to get endorsed by Jeff Sessions and he didn't.

Jeff Sessions endorsed me, which is a very big endorsement. And Ted Cruz still doesn't believe what happened. He couldn't believe it, because they work together. And it doesn't say much about somebody when you have almost no Senate endorsements. You have Lee, but you have almost no Senate endorsements and you work with the people all the time.

So we worked very, very closely with many people, like Jeff Sessions. We worked closely with top people from Israel. And I'm going to be making a speech about it in a little while.

UNIDENTIFIED: (OFF-MIKE)

DONALD TRUMP: Say it again.

UNIDENTIFIED: (OFF-MIKE)

DONALD TRUMP: Not so much evolved. I said I want to make -- I was asked certain questions. I said I want to make a decision. I will announce it in the not-too-distant future. And that's what I'm going to do today at about 5:00. OK?

Yes.

UNIDENTIFIED: (OFF-MIKE)

DONALD TRUMP: Thank you.

UNIDENTIFIED: (OFF-MIKE)

DONALD TRUMP: Are you talking about here? We're doing some of that actually already. We have been very much involved.

Why, what are you looking for? What kind of a position? Come up here. Come here. She looks so smart and good.

You mind if I do a job interview right now? We need good people. How are you?

UNIDENTIFIED: I'm fine.

DONALD TRUMP: So what's your experience, in front of the world?

UNIDENTIFIED: Well, I design. I do reefs. I do all types of decorations.

DONALD TRUMP: And you like this building?

UNIDENTIFIED: Yes, I do.

DONALD TRUMP: OK, so here's what I'm going to do. There's the man. Stand right over here.

If we can make a good deal on the salary, she's going to probably have a job, OK? All right. Good. Have a good time. Thank you, sweetie. Thank you.

Thank you. So nice. Really nice.

Yes, go ahead.

UNIDENTIFIED: (OFF-MIKE)

DONALD TRUMP: Just to start getting together with some of the people that I have known over the years, politicians. In just about all cases, they were senators or congressmen. Jim DeMint was there, who I have great respect for, and some others.

And we just had a really good meeting, just a meeting. And they can't believe how far we have come, because, you know, I think a lot of people maybe wouldn't have predicted that. I think people that know me did predict that. But some people would not have. And it was really just a meeting. It's a beginning meeting. But it was a very good one with a lot of the most respected people in Washington.

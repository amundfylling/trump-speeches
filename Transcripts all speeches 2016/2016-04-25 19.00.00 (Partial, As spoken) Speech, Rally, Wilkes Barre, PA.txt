DONALD TRUMP: Do we love our country? Do we love our country? This is amazing.

(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

And we love Wilkes-Barre. Is that right? We love Wilkes-Barre. We love this area.

(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

And we love the state of Pennsylvania and we're bringing it back.

(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

We're bringing it back. Thank you, everybody. Wow, what a turnout.

And they have 6,000 people outside that can't get in. This place is unbelievable. Hello up there. Unbelievable.

(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

So, we have a lot to talk about. This is my last stop. Tomorrow is so important. You're going to go out and vote. Who is going to vote for Trump?

(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

We're going to make that the best vote you ever have cast, I promise you, I promise you, believe me. America First, folks. Make America great again, but America First. OK? Remember that.

So, just a couple things. And my son Eric is here. You know Eric? He's great, good boy.

And this area, he said, dad, make sure you mention natural gas, that we're 100 percent behind it. And we are, 100 -- natural gas, and coal, and coal. We're 100 percent. We're going to bring things back and we're going to bring them back like they have never been before. We are going to take our jobs back. We're bringing our manufacturing back.

We're going to take it from all of these countries that for years have been ripping us off because we have politicians that don't know what they are doing. So we're going to take it back.

(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

So, you know, the whole deal, you know, this whole thing is crazy.

We're leading by millions of votes. We're leading by hundreds of delegates, and it's a rigged system.

But I said, you know, let it be rigged. I talk about the boxers. I have a boxer. He's fantastic. A friend of mine, he is a world champion. And he goes into a very unfriendly territory. I said, what are you doing? If you have a good match, you are going to end up losing on a decision with bad judges.

He said, Mr. Trump, the only way I have to do it, I have to knock this guy out. I have to knock him on his ass.

(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

And he did. And he picked up a big paycheck.

So what we're doing is, we're going to win on the first ballot. We only care about the first ballot. And it's sort of interesting, because if you look at these two guys, one is one for 41. I won many, many states.

Millions of votes ahead, many states, many delegates. The other one, he's like a total disaster. He goes to New York last week, he doesn't even register, he's so low. He got no delegates. Folks, they ought to both drop out of the race, so we ought to unify the Republican Party.

(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

And a great poll just came out. You saw it on the top of Drudge, a great poll that has me even with Hillary Clinton. That's nothing. I haven't started with Crooked Hillary yet. We haven't even started.

(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

Amazing. Amazing.

Ah, that Crooked Hillary, the same old stuff, years and years of watching it. It's always the same. But she's not bringing back jobs. She doesn't know the first thing about it. She's going to open up the borders. And I don't know if you saw reports today. More people are pouring across our southern border than practically ever before. It's out of control. (BOOING) It's out of control. We don't know who these people are. We don't know where the hell they come from. And they're pouring across. And the Border Patrol, who are amazing people, just so you know, last week, the Border Patrol endorsed Donald Trump, 16,500 people. They have never done it before Never done it before. Amazing. They are amazing people. They are amazing people. And Sheriff Joe endorsed. You know Sheriff Joe from Arizona. So, no, we're going to do a great job. But they are setting records. People are coming across. We don't know where they are. And then you have coming from the migration thousands and thousands of people, and they are coming here. Nobody even knows where they are going. They put them all over the country. Nobody knows. Are they ISIS? It could be the great Trojan horse. Nobody knows

We will build a wall. Don't worry about it, man. We will build a wall.

(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

That wall is going to get built.

AUDIENCE: Build the wall! Build the wall! Build the wall! Build the wall! Build the wall! Build the wall! Build the wall! Build the wall!

(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

DONALD TRUMP: This place is unbelievable. This place is unbelievable.

(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

All right. So, look, so I go to the...

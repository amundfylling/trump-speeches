DONALD TRUMP: Love each other and we're going to do so well. And, by the way, before we forget, Chris, so important tomorrow, North Carolina, you have to go out and vote.

CHRIS CHRISTIE: Yes.

DONALD TRUMP: You have to vote.

CHRIS CHRISTIE: Absolutely. And -- and you've talked a lot at recent rallies about how you want to unify the country.

DONALD TRUMP: Right.

CHRIS CHRISTIE: And how divided the country is now by this president and how you want to unify it. And I think people would love to hear about the way you wanted to unify.

DONALD TRUMP: Yes, the country is so divided, it's incredible. And, you know, it's very sad when you look and even -- even when you have some of these protesters, the level -- the level of anger from all sides, including the anger from our side. We're angry. Now, we're not angry people, I'll tell you that. We're not angry people. We're all good -- we're good people. But there's a lot of anger.

And there's anger, Chris, at incompetence. There's anger when you look at the trade deals. There's anger when you look at our military, where we can't beat ISIS. We can't beat ISIS. And, you know, there's anger at the fact that America, the United States, it doesn't win anymore. We don't win on trade. We don't win with the military. We can't take care of our vets who are so important. We're going to take care of our vets.

Education is a disaster. Education. Common Core we're getting rid of, by the way. We're going to bring education locally.

And -- but you just look at it. You just look at it. They're chopping away at the Second Amendment. We're not going to let that happen anymore. We're not going to let it happen.

And I have to tell you, healthcare, Obamacare is a disaster. We're going to repeal and replace it. We're going to repeal it and replace it. But -- but, Chris, you know, the -- a certain governor got up and spoke after a presidential address and sort of alluded to the anger. And the next night I was at a debate, one of the debates. You know they say I've won every debate I think I have. I think -- I think if I didn't, we wouldn't be here today, right? I would have been like the other people, out.

But -- but the question was, it was Nicki Haley and she said, well, there's great anger, great -- like it's a bad thing. And they asked me during the debate, Nikki Haley said that you and a lot of your supporters have great anger. Now, I'm supposed to say, oh, no, we don't have anger. We're wonderful people. We're so happy with the way the country's run. I said, wait a minute, I'm not going to -- I'm going to tell the truth. I said, yes, I'm angry. Yes, the millions of people that are supporting Trump, and I'm supporting them, we're all angry because we're tired of a government that is run incompetently. We have incompetent people running our country.

And I said, we're tired of the Iran deal, where we give Iran a terror state, we give Iran $150 billion. We -- we have prisoners in -- prisoners in there for years. We should have never even started that negotiation until those prisoners were released, that I can tell you. (BREAK)

So it's one of those things. One thing, Chris, that's interesting, two years ago, they went out to bid with the old post office in Washington, D.C., the single best location in Washington and everybody wanted it. One of the most sought-after projects in the history of the GSA. Everyone wanted it and I ended up getting it. And I got it because my financial statement was the best or right there along with all these other great, in many cases, big public companies, hotel companies, and also because we had the best job, the best concept. We'll build a tremendous super luxury hotel, one of the best anywhere in the country, and I think maybe the best in the country. But interesting, I got it in the Obama administration. If you think about it, the Obama administration, everyone wanted it, all the major hotel companies, Waldorf Astoria, so many different companies wanted it. And what we have now, we started construction. We're over a year in terms of schedule, we're a year ahead of schedule, we're right on budget, even under budget. And I'd be way under budget except I upped to marble. We're using marble instead of terrazzo. We're using all of the finest materials. In the end, it will be great. But the point is it's under schedule, under budget. It's open September. It wasn't supposed to open for many months after that. It would be great if when we do the infrastructure of our country, we could be under budget and ahead of schedule.

(CHEERING)

That's what we want to see.

(CHEERING)

CHRIS CHRISTIE: And I think that relates to one of the big issues you've brought up in the campaign, which is trade. And how would you bring the same kind of principles you've brought to building great property, managing a great company, to our relationship with trade with other countries around the world?

DONALD TRUMP: Right, because one of the biggest problems we have in our country is trade. We're bad traders. We have the worst people representing us. We have political hacks. We have political hacks. We have a trade deficit with China this year, $505 billion. Think of it. $505 Billion. We have a trade deficit with Japan that is shocking. We have -- by the way, with Mexico. I have great relationships with Mexico and with Hispanic people. I employ thousands of Hispanics. They're great. But with Mexico, we have a $50 billion trade deficit. And when I say we'll build a wall, which we will, by the way. But we will build a wall --

(CHEERING)

They love the wall. Love the wall. We love the wall. We love the wall. We'll build a wall, folks. We're going to build a wall. Are you ready? Who is going to pay for the wall?

(SHOUTING)

100 percent correct. OK.

(CHEERING)

And when I get off stage with like Marco and I get off stage with Kasich and --

(SHOUTING)

(BOOING)

(SHOUTING)

(CHANTING)

U.S.A.. U.S.A.. U.S.A..

(CHANTING)

(CHEERING)

CHRIS CHRISTIE: All right.

(CHEERING)

(SHOUTING)

(CHANTING)

DONALD TRUMP: Thank you.

(CHANTING)

CHRIS CHRISTIE: All right.

(CHEERING)

DONALD TRUMP: You know, it is amazing that we have tremendous rallies, sometimes 25,000, 30,000. We had one, two weeks ago, in Alabama, 35,000 people. No disruption. No nothing. But the press is now calling this saying, oh, but there is such violence. You know how many people have been hurt at our rallies? I think like basically none, other than I guess maybe somebody got hit once or something. But there is no violence. And you know, in Chicago, we canceled because I didn't want to see them. There was a huge group of people formed, like 3,000. We're going to have 25,000 people in Chicago. And they have given me a lot of credit, Chris, because rather than having the rally and having people fighting, because we feel great -- the people that are supporters of Donald Trump want to see America be great again. That's what it is. That's what it is.

(CHEERING)

It's simple. So rather than fighting in Chicago, I did something that was a good move, a good decision, because I don't want to see anybody be hurt. And what happened is -- and we've been given so much credit for that decision. Nobody hurt, no problem. It went away. But because of that, people say, well, is there violence. There is no violence. There's a love fest. These are love fests. And every once in a while --

(CHEERING)

I mean, sometimes, like you just had somebody will stand up and say something and the police, who are so great, by the way, in all cases, they're great.

(CHEERING)

But somebody will stand up and they will say something and a lot of times they're kids and they don't know where they're coming from and they will have a Bernie sign. Bernie is going nowhere. You know that.

(CHEERING)

But they will have a Bernie sign.

(BOOING)

Probably given to them by Bernie. They're the Bernie signs. They're made by machine. They're made the same signs that you see. And possibly or probably given to them by Bernie's people. But it's a little disruption. But there is no violence. There's none whatsoever. And I'll tell you what. We go and these things are so incredible. It's a movement and it's a love fest, and we love each other, and we're going to so well.

And before we forget, Chris, so important, tomorrow, North Carolina, you have to go out and vote. You have to vote.

(CHEERING)

DONALD TRUMP: Oh, wow, wow, that's so nice, thank you, thank you, this man is a vet, is a vet, we love our vets. Thank you, everybody, sit down please. We had about 24 hours to put this together, it was very, very quick and we're here for some very special people and we're going to hear from some of them. But this is an honor, this is a really honor. And I didn't want to be here, I have to be honest, I wanted to be about five minutes away, and I've enjoyed that, I've enjoyed that, all the online polls said I've done very well with that with the debates, and I've had a kick with it. But you have to stick up for your rights, when you're treated badly, you have to stick up for your rights.

(APPLAUSE)

You have to do it. And whether we like or not, whether it is something we want to do or not, and that's what our country has to do. I mean as an example, Iran, the way they've been treating us with all of this horrible -- this deal is one the worst deals I've ever seen negotiated under any circumstances. And we just take, we have to stick up for ourselves as people and we have to stick for our country when we are being mistreated. Remember that.

(APPLAUSE)

And I have to go a little step further and say that Fox has been extremely nice the last number of hours actually. And they wanted me there and they said, how about now, they called a few minutes, how about now? Can you come over? I said hasn't it already started? And we actually thought what we'd do is we'd let them start and you know we wanted to be about 15 minutes into that hour so that by now they're all tuned -- oh, look at all the cameras like the Academy Awards, this is like the Academy Awards. This is the Academy Awards.

(APPLAUSE)

We're actually told that we have more cameras than they do by quite a bit so that's sort of interesting, and you know what, that's really in honor of our vets, but they have been, they've been very nice and they wanted me to go and apologize and everything else, and they did apologize and they could not have been -- but once this started it's for our vets, there was nothing I could do. I don't know and you know what, I don't know. Is it for me personally a good thing, a bad thing, will I get more votes, will I get less votes? Nobody knows, who the hell knows but it's for our vets and you're going to like it because we raised over $5 million in one day.

(APPLAUSE)

Over five million. So that's not so bad, you know, my whole theme is make America great again. And that's what we're going to do, and we wouldn't of even been here if it weren't for our vets, and our vets are being mistreated. Illegal immigrants are treated better in many cases than our vets, and it's not going to happen anymore, it's not going to happen anymore.

(APPLAUSE)

So once this ball started rolling, we couldn't stop it and you see the house is packed and literally this took place less than 24 hours, we had less than 24 hours to do this. Because I said, listen, I'm not going to do the debate out of respect for myself, I won't do it because it would just be wrong. But I've got to -- you know, I love Iowa I'm here we've got to do something, I didn't know we were going to raise 5 million, we actually raised close to 6 to be totally honest. But and I have to say a lot more to come, you know, we set up a site, www. donaldtrumpforvets. com, forvets. com. And they've raised almost $500,000 just today so I think this money is just going to continue to pour in, and we have some incredible, incredible people. I do want to say, I do want call out some of the folks that gave a lot of the money. And then we're going to have somebody come up to speak whose an incredible speaker but much importantly it's the subject. Somebody that really, really understands what the vets are going through. But first we have to talk about people that made a lot of money, and they wouldn't have made a lot of money, they wouldn't even be here if it weren't for the vets and our great military. Because the military right, Phil, has a lot more guts than you do. Is that right? We have different kind of guts, right. So, Carl Icahn gave $500,000, one quick phone call, would $500,000 be OK? Richard LeFrak a great builder in New York gave a $100,000. Donald Trump another great builder in New York now a politician, I can't stand this -- a politician, I don't want to be called a politician. All talk, no action, I refuse to be called a politician. Donald Trump gave $1 million. OK.

(APPLAUSE)

The Fischer family of New York gave $75,000, Howard Lorber a great fan and friend of our family, $100,000. A very, very rich man in New York, a very good friend of mine a very good person and he wants to be anonymous. The first time in his life, all his life he was out there. Now I said, do me a favor, could you give me a million bucks for this. He said, what. I said don't worry about it just give me a million. He said, no, no, at least tell me. I said it's for the vets, he said you got it. Is that good? Right? And he wanted to be anonymous, I don't know he's changed because you know what, you know who I'm talking about, two years ago -- yes?

(APPLAUSE)

It really is too crazy, right. You know I tell the story, I love protests. I love protests at my rallies because you know here, this is a beautiful place but we have thousands of people outside that weren't as good in real estate as you folks I will tell you. But we have thousands of people outside trying to get in. We set up cameras, we set up screens, we have everything. But I will tell you, you look at that, I love the protesters in the big arenas because the cameras never move. They are always on my face. And I say to my wife, Melania, honey, stand up. She has to suffer through this.

No, I go home, and it's always broadcast, you know they can never let me like the other politicians, nobody cares, nobody is covering them, look at this, it's like crazy. But I say, how did I do, she said, you were great. Were there many people there? I said what you mean there were 21,000, it is like in the Maverick's arena, or it was I remember in Alabama. Mobile, Alabama, we had 35,000 people -- by the way we get the biggest crowds by far. Much bigger than Bernie although I have to say that he is second, he is second, no other Republican. But we get the biggest crowds and she will say but they never show the crowd. And I say, would you mean they never show the crowd? And I realized they never turn the camera, and I always say, you know, I figured maybe they are fixed, these are new cameras that they can't turn. The only way you find out that they are not fixed, they are like pretzels the way they can turn them, is when you have a protester. You could have protesters up in the top and they are turned around sideways, they turn but they don't want to show the crowd. So it's one of those things.

So we have a rich man from New York, a good guy who's become a little bit reclusive obviously, $1 million, he's a great guy. We have another unbelievable man, Ike Perlmutter from Marvel he did such an unbelievable job, one of the great, great men of our country in terms of business and talent. And he is giving, Ike and Mary Perlmutter, $1 million.

(APPLAUSE)

J. J. Cafaro from Florida and from Cleveland, he's a man who made a lot of money in Cleveland, does a good job, and a fantastic man, $50,000. J. J., thank you.

(APPLAUSE)

Another great friend of mine one of the most brilliant men you will ever meet, a phenomenal world class, you wouldn't even know it, he doesn't do that for a living, he makes money for a living in every way. You cannot make a deal with this guy and come out on top, it's impossible. In fact I'm thinking about him for China, how about him negotiating with China, OK? You know China this year in trade will make over $500 billion in terms of our trade deficit, $500 billion. That's no partnership and I'm a free trader, I love free trade, but we have to use our head, and we use political hacks to negotiate with the Chinese, and they have the smartest people. I deal with them all the time, I love the Chinese, they buy my apartments for millions, I have their largest bank in the world from China and one of my buildings. I love them.

I'm not blaming the Chinese, I'm not angry at them, I'm angry other politicians because we have people that are incompetent running our country. Why should we be losing in trade deficits $500 billion a year? So it's not going to happen. So if I took a guy like this, put him in charge, his wife is so incredible, would you both come up? Mr. and Mrs. Phil Ruffin, come on up, come up.

(APPLAUSE)

He's never had anything, it's like everything he touches turns to gold. Whatever deal he goes into, he bought a piece of land in Las Vegas, spent $110 million, he sold it a few years later and made plenty of money in between $41. 3 billion, right. Just about 1. 3. I think he says more. So when he gives $1 million it's like you know what that says, ten cents, but for him very important. Phil Ruffin, just say a couple of words.

PHIL RUFFIN: Thank you, I'd like to introduce my wife, Alexandra, Donald and I have been friends for some 18 years and business partners, and about two years ago, I said if you ever run for president I will give you $1 million. Well, he ran, I gave him $1 million, he sent it back. He said I can't take your money, I couldn't believe it. In any case he's a great man and I'm very happy, my wife and I will donate $1 million to your charity. And thank you.

(APPLAUSE)

DONALD TRUMP: He actually sent me $1 million and he said there's 10 or 20 more of them, if you want it, if you need it, and I sent it back. I just can't stand. You know I am self funding my own campaign, right. I'm sorry. But all my life I made money, I made money, I've always been good making money, I think I have great imagination. But I made money. In all my life I did well. My father always said, everything you touch turns to gold, that's why I use the same expression on him because he was a guy believe me, fantastic guy. But he always said everything my boy touches turns to gold. And what happened is I turned all this money down, they're calling and calling. They want to give me money because being number one, they all want to control you. They want to give you money and now they call you, remember I gave you $5 million. I told the story about the Ford plant, about the Nabisco plant, so what happens is all my life and I am turning down millions. And I was in Iowa in a different location we had 4,000 people. And I went to those people and I said listen, I don't feel good about turning down money because my whole life I've been greedy, greedy, greedy. I grabbed all the money I can get, I'm so gritty but now I want to be greedy for the United States. I want to grab all that money. I'm going to be greedy for the United States.

(APPLAUSE)

And it's true but I always felt guilty, so I'm in this beautiful place. The crowd is lovely. We have the most incredible people in this country in Iowa. But in this country, it's like a movement going on. The cover of Time magazine this week is a whole thing. It's a cover story. In fact, there it is. Hold that up. They have the back of my head with a massive crowd in front of me, and they are covering the story, and I said I didn't even know they were doing the story, and it's the cover of Time. They are talking about the movement. It is actually a movement. But what's happening is, I said to the crowd, let me ask you this one thing, supposing and I promise you I won't be influenced, could I take all this money. Because I am turning away so much money, stand up please, could I take all this money? And everybody went crazy, no, no, no. That was only one guy and he was in the back corner of the room, and he was a crooked looking guy. He was the only guy. He looked like such a crook. And he said, it's OK to take it and I look at that guy said, I don't want to have anything to do with that. That's the only guy.

So I feel a little bit foolish not taking the money, but you look at a guy like Jeb Bush, he's taking -- low energy, is taking 120 -- extremely low, so I shouldn't say, he's debating right now, maybe he's doing great. He's probably looking for me, he's saying, has anyone seen Trump? Where's Trump, where is he? Where is he?

(APPLAUSE)

Jeb, he's taken $128 million, people that I know, killers, killers, like him, killers, they put up $5 million, $2 million, $8 million. They are lobbyists, their special interests, they are not doing that for their health. And whenever we have a problem you know a lot of times, I was telling the other day because I know most lobbyists, I mean I've used them. I was on the other side. Seven months ago I was on the other side, I was a big giver, but I know these people, and I said, believe me when they 6 million, 5 million 1 million, they are not just doing it. They want something for it. And when you see these horrible deals that are being made, and they are horrible. The politicians aren't that stupid. You think they are horrible, you say, I was a possible letter Iran just got $150 billion from this country on one of the dumbest deals ever. And they just went out and their first purchase is a 114 Airbus jets, not Boeing jets.

And then we have from France and from other countries in Europe, and think of it, and then go to Russia, they are buying missiles. And somebody said you know the 24 days, they have 24 days but the clock doesn't start ticking for almost so it could be forever. They actually do a self inspections, can you imagine it. And we didn't get our prisoners, I call them hostages. We didn't get them back and then we get the money, so we paid $150 billion sets such a bad tone for kidnapping, that it is a disgrace. So who would believe this, who would believe what's going on? But when you see that Airbus gets our jets, Russia gets the missiles which by the way they are not supposed to be ordering, just so you understand. Big order, missiles and other things from Russia, everybody is getting the money but us. But when you see the politicians and you say, man, that's a bad deal. That's such a stupid deal. How can anybody be so stupid?

The reason is the politicians are being taken care of by their lobbyists and their special interests, that have interests with Airbus, that have interests with Russia and missiles, that have Airbus with all of these people that are taking at $150 billion. Now one of the things, and by the way, Mike Huckabee sitting right here, Governor, get up for a second, get up.

(APPLAUSE)

Great guy, and Rick Santorum, Senator, where is Rick? Rick.

(APPLAUSE)

And fellows come up for a second, but just so you understand, and these two are not in that category, come on up, Rick, come on up, Governor. They are the only two politicians, they would never do anything like this. Come on. Come on up. Look.

(APPLAUSE)

Stand up here. And Mrs. Huckabee, and Rick's daughter, stand up, stand up.

(APPLAUSE)

So these two people do not fit, they would never ever have done anything like that. But when you see deals that are so bad, believe me they are not bad for the politician, they are bad for the country, and that's why I don't take anything. I don't take anything. We're going to do what's right. We're going to do what's right for the country. OK, thank you. I want to ask Rick and Mike to say a few words. I heard they did really well these two, and who the hell knows I didn't get the see very much of it. I said how did they do? I think if we did poorly you probably wouldn't be here right now, did go back and you'd be depressed right? So Rick say a few words, Mike say a few words. We'd love it.

RICK SANTORUM: Thank you so much, thank you. Not to be offensive I'll stand a little bit over here so I'm not photographed with the Trump sign. I'm supporting another candidate for President, that doesn't mean we can work together when it comes to helping our veterans, and that's what Mike and I are here doing tonight. I grew up on a V.A. grounds, my mom and dad worked for the Veterans Administration for 40 years, and I watched it over that time, and I heard my parents talk about how the V.A. system has been degraded over time. It used to be the best healthcare system in the world, it's not the best healthcare system in the world, and we have an obligation to do something to make sure our veterans have the best possible healthcare in the world.

(APPLAUSE)

And we can give them that by allowing every restaurant to go to any hospital in their community to get the care that they need when they need it. We also have to say to our Veterans Administration you know what, let the private sector take care of the stuff, we have a big problem with our veterans. And I hope a lot of the money that's raised tonight goes for that, 22 vets a day commit suicide, 22 vets a day commit suicide. Because of PTSD and related mental illnesses, here is what I would like to do, let's take all that money for the V.A., and let's put into making the Veterans Administration a center of excellence to deal with PTSD and take care of our vets with their mental health problems.

(APPLAUSE) So I appreciate all those folks who raised money, let's put some of that money toward helping our men and women who are suffering the most and I will be very happy to be here to make sure that that happens, and God bless you and thank you for being here tonight.

(APPLAUSE)

MIKE HUCKABEE: I figure you're going to get the photo here anyway, I might as well just adhere and be done with it. Look, let me be very clear, Rick Santorum, Donald Trump and I may be competitors in a presidential race, but tonight we are colleagues in unison standing here for the people who lead us to breathe every breath of free air we breathe, the veterans of the United States of America, without you there is no government.

(APPLAUSE)

You see in my mind I was hearing you say go Huck go. But I want to say how grateful I am to Donald Trump for inviting us here because the easy thing for him to do is to simply ignore that anybody else cares about veterans, and he's not that kind of person. And I want to say thank you, Donald Trump, for asking Rick Santorum and me, and I think he would've let any other candidates come. And for reasons that maybe I don't understand, they're not here, some of them because it had a slot at 8 o'clock, I had nothing to do it 8 o'clock tonight, this works great for me. But it says something about him, that he would bring us here to his own event because bigger than even the election is the fact that we wouldn't have free elections in this country, if it were for the people who stood between bullets, bombs and our freedom. And thank you.

(APPLAUSE)

I want to do one simple thing tonight, I'm done, I'll turn it back to Donald Trump. In September 2005 a very good friend of mine who teaches school at the Joe T. Robinson high school in Little Rock, Arkansas did something pretty extraordinary on the first day of school. She got permission of the principal, she had all the desks from her classroom removed, every desk taken out. The kids came in for first and they said Ms. Cothren, her name is Martha Cothren, her dad was a World War II POW, so she takes all the desks out, when they come in they say, where's our desks. She says you don't get a desk in my class until you can tell me how you earn it?

World, the kids said I guess we get good grades. She said no that's important, you need to do that but that's not going to get you a desk. Another kid said well, we have to behave. She said oh you will behave in my class. But that won't get you a desk. And none of them could figure it out. Second period came, same thing. You don't get a desk until you tell me how you earned it. Third period, fourth period. By now kids are calling their parents on cell phones and saying Ms. Cothren has lost her mind, she won't let us have a desk. News from Little Rock started coming out to Joe T. Robinson high school in the early afternoon to figure out what has happened with this teacher who has snapped? Because she is taken all the desks out of her classroom. Last period of the day, the kids came in and asked the same question, where are our desks? And she said you have to tell me how you earn it? None of them did. She said I guess I'm going to have to explain to you, Martha Cothren walked over to the door of her classroom, she opened the door, data 27 U. S. veterans wearing their uniforms from various wars walked in carrying a desk. They brought those desks in and line them up in rows and as they did Martha Cothren said on ID that I am sure will never be forgotten by those students, she said, kids, you don't have to earn your desk because these guys they already did. That's why you have a school desk, that's why you have an education, and that's why you have the United States of America. God bless you and thank you.

(APPLAUSE)

DONALD TRUMP: Two amazing people, really great people, I've gotten to know them very well, being on the trail as they say, and I'm very happy with what's going on the trail, I've had an amazing period of time. And I'm not going to be doing polls tonight usually I like to get and do polls, and everybody even Mike would say, why do you keep doing those polls? I say because they are so good, you know when you -- but we've had amazing polls in Iowa, we've had amazing polls no matter where we have been, and we are leading now by a substantial margins in Iowa and every single state. We are leading every national poll because people...

(APPLAUSE)

People are tired and they are sick of seeing what's going on with our country, how incompetently we are run, how are military is being decimated, and for tonight you know as an example what's happening tonight. You see the kind of love in this room, there is amazing love, the veterans are the most amazing, the warmest, the best people. And we are going to take care about veterans. So I just think it's great. So I'm going to introduce somebody who's going to speak for little while, and I said take your time he's going to introduce a couple of his friends, but he's been through a lot, and John Wayne Walding I think a lot have heard, actually become a very famous person, he should be much more famous than me because he's a lot more courageous than I am. I will say either financially courageous, but the other stuff I don't know I'm so good.

So he spent 12 years in the United States Army, with seven of those years being in the 3rd Special Forces Group, top of line at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. He has combat deployments to both Iraq and Afghanistan, and during his career at the Third Special Forces Group, really the elite, these are the best. He worked on a Special Forces operator, and as an operator at the sniper detachment and as a sniper instructor. He is a phenomenal world-class marksman, his military school experience includes special operations, target, interdicting courses, special forces advanced urban combat. Not easy, third SFG advanced sniper Special Forces qualifications courses, and airborne and air assault. He's got every single thing in the book. John's awards and badges include Silver Star, Bronze Star, Purple Heart, Combat Infantry badge, Airborne Air Assault and Air Special Forces tag.

John participated in numerous battles during his deployment most famous of all was the battle of Shok valley which was a tough one, a really tough one, unbelievable bad results and brilliant results, the victory was brilliant but tremendous, tremendous carnage. Which you can read about in the new book, No Way Out -- a story of valor in the mountains of Afghanistan, John lost a leg. He is an amazing guy, and I heard him speak once before, I was so impressed I just asked him to come up over and say a few words, and also introduce you're very brave friends. Come on up, John Wayne, come on.

(APPLAUSE)

JOHN WAYNE WALDING: Thank you, thank you very much. Man, I tell you what I feel cooler than Burt Reynolds up here getting introduced by Donald Trump, this is awesome, please sit down. Sit down, sit down, if you don't mind I'm going to keep moving as I talk because in the military a moving target is a lot harder to hit. That and well, I'm one legged so standing still sucks, so I'm going to keep talking to you all as I move, and also in the military's is how we caught everybody going to sleep. You know I want to thank all of you all for coming out and Trump's here, I'm not here for politics I want to make that absolutely clear, I'm here for people.

I don't care about Republican or Democrat, I care about America and I've known Donald Trump Junior for a while now, he's never asked me for one thing politically, but I know what he has done is seen me at his hotel, Trump International Las Vegas, while I was at a conference in Vegas for Shot show, had a lot of gun companies and I was in the restaurant. Being Mr. Trump, he was eating with Willie Robertson, Doug Dynasty guy, real cool guy, introduced myself and said thank you for coming and everything. And Mr. Trump left, well, he came back and he squatted next to my table and talk to me for almost an hour. And didn't ask one thing he just genuinely wanted to say hi and let me know that he cared about my service, he wanted me to make sure that I had a good time.

So I'm here for people, I'm here for people as great as he is, and the Trump organization, I hate how many people say they get the bad rap, you know another story that I know that no one knows is I remember Donald and his son senior or correction his wife a long time ago, they broke down. Nobody would ever help some and finally a couple stopped, they help them with their vehicle, and help them get transportation, will guess what they did, they paid off their mortgage. Did you ever hear about that? No. Because they are people, they are genuine people, and that is the movement that I think that everybody in America is actually getting onto, is that he is unapologetically American. That's what we are. We are Americans absolutely.

America is the greatest thing that's ever happened to this planet and its existence, and why should I ever say I'm sorry for that? Tell me that. Mr. Trump, he says things that may not make you feel good but it is a better thing for this great country. And that's what I care about, is a better thing for this country. Now why I'm here, they told me at first I only had a little bit of time so if you know me by now you know getting me to talk for a little bit is about as easy as probably finding Hillary Clinton's emails you know. It just ain't going to happen. Right. So I was very pleased to hear him say that I could get up and speak to you and so for that, Mr. Trump. Thank you very much.

But like they said my name is John Wayne Walding, on the Green Beret born on Fourth of July and I'm from Groesbeck, Texas. So you are welcome America. You can't write this you know. On that note I asked my dad one day because this is my true name I really am John Wayne Walding, really was born on the Fourth of July. Can I asked my dad one day when I was about 16, a river asking dad why did you name me that, they can I probably get this great story about he was a great American and blah blah blah. He said it just like this and I quote, "Had a cool birthday, so you needed a cool name. "

He's kind of a hippie, but I'm glad you thought about it because I'm not stuck with it, but I became the Green Beret, like I said I did 12 years in the military and the majority of that in Special Forces as a Green Beret, people didn't know the actual true term for Green Berets is Special Forces. Special Operations is what they always make the Navy SEALs and Rangers and everybody else, that's what they fall under. And one thing I didn't know as a Green Beret and while I was in Special Operations, over 6 percent of all the missions that are done are done by Green Berets.

Why does no one know that? We don't write books, we don't be in movies, we do the job. A good friend of mine was Chris Cowan and he was a Navy SEAL. And it was always really fun whenever we be out at a training event, and to get the Army sniper group. Navy SEAL sniper, you suck, no you suck, well, you know. That was fun banter back and forth but so that's statistics, we go the most, we die the most, we get hurt the most. Navy SEAL Foundation has got, this is an old stat but around 35 million, and Green Beret Foundation had three. It is one of the things that Americans don't realize that we do our job, our motto is quiet professionals. And one thing that we've learned or is a true difference between quiet and silent professionals. That is what I am trying to be as humbly as possible to let people know that the job of a Green Beret is we teach them to die for their country rather than us doing it. That's pretty good mission, right.

Instead of sending 100 Americans into this village to kill the bad guy, why don't we send 15 Green Berets in to teach thousand of their army and let them do it. So that's what John F. Kennedy back in the 60s actually donned the Green Berets and let us have our job and we are good at it, and that's what we love to do within 30 days of the towers falling, there were Green Berets in Afghanistan and haven't left yet and were not going to leave. So that's my propaganda for their so I'm a little biased.

OK so I lost my leg in Afghanistan in 2008 in a firefight in the battle of Shok valley that pretty much we were supposed to win. If you ever believe in God, that's why I believe in God because there is no reason we should be alive. About 15 Americans went up along with Afghani commandos, we went up against over 200 insurgents, when they had the elevated position on the mountain, and after 6 1/2 hours, 70 danger close airstrikes, 10 Silver Stars given, we won.

(APPLAUSE)

How awesome is that? Zero American lives were killed. How can you be a Taliban or ISIS or whatever command were 15 Americans can go wipe out 200 of you, I don't know how they do it. I'd be in the back of the formation going hey guys I've got something to do tomorrow, and I don't know. So that's when I lost my leg and I got shot halfway through the battle had to put a tourniquet on my leg along with the help of a fellow Green Beret. During the battle it was literally folded halfway over, excuse the gore, but halfway over and only hanging by an inch of flesh, and on the objective I turned it into my groin, I said crotch twice on national television.

I remember what my wife asked me, really John, that's what we're -- OK, I married you forever. I say groin now into my area, and that's how I got off the mountain carrying my leg and fighting next to my brothers. That's not the end of the story.

(APPLAUSE)

Thank you, yes. I tell everybody you should see the other guy, yes, check out the other guy. But that's not the end of the story, that's the beginning. And that's why am here. That's the beginning of me learning the word can't. Green Beret barrel-chested freedom fighter can't, I cannot walk. I can't walk without the help of a prosthetic leg, and let me tell you something that is gut wrenching punch that I hope none of you ever have to feel because as a not only a father but a husband and a provider for the family, when you lose that leg that is an instant insecurity that you go into about am I good enough?

Am I OK to make sure my family has food? Can I still provide? And three things is what made me get better, first and foremost is God because without him we be nothing, amen. Amen. That's the first thing, the second thing is my wife and family, my beautiful wife who is Amy if you're watching, love you sugar. But that is absolutely my wife and family making sure that every single day I have a compass to look forward to and say thank you. And the third thing that made me want to always continue to lean forward and fight hard is you, Americans, great Americans that get it. Absolutely get it.

It's the Americans that say the two words, thank you. Never underestimate the magnitude of what the two words thank you mean to veterans. If you don't believe me ask a Vietnam guy. Ask somebody in Vietnam what it's like to come back and get spit on? Has somebody in Vietnam what it is like to get called a baby killer? I tell you right now if I lost my leg for my country and I got spit on, I'd be homeless single and having an addiction problem because those two words are absolutely that mental validation that says it's worth it. Right? That's what everything we do, it says it's worth it.

I like to joke and I like to have one and I always like to say I make one leg it look good you know, I don't have a face for radio, I'm up here but it's not too bad. I'll be honest with you if I didn't tell that it sucks being one-legged. It sucks not being able to do calf raises, it sucks not to be able to walk to the bathroom in the middle of the night. It sucks whenever your kids are wanting to play soccer and you can't do it because you've been working all day with a real job trying to make your money. But it's worth it, why? Because thank you. Great Americans like yourselves and say thank you and a mix of mental validation says it's worth it, and what does that do? That makes me not just want to be a husband, but a loving husband, not just a father but an involved, an actual loving and compassionate father, somebody that wants to be with them. Not just a citizen but a successful, a productive citizen of society somebody that wants to actually be with other Americans and not just begin that wall or that prison that they call home, because nobody ever validated their sacrifice.

So again never underestimate the magnitude of what thank you means to veterans.

(APPLAUSE)

DONALD TRUMP: You're worth it.

JOHN WAYNE WALDING: So when I hear those two words and somebody says thank you, I say you're worth it. Because you are worth fighting for, you are worth fighting for because we are the best place in the country to live. All right, God bless you. All right. So when you say thank you I say you're worth and I mean it. But let me tell you something else though we lose 22 vets a day to suicide and lack of transition, and I can tell you that I felt that first hand, because not only when you get back, the military gives you a big old shopping cart full of drugs, that says hey you got shot take these it will make you feel better.

And about after a year I realized I'm healed, you know, I'm healed, my leg ain't growing back I tried, you know. So anyway I've tried it ain't going to heal my incisions, stitches, everything out, it's not going to heal but guess what, I still hurt. I hurt every single day and I know that will take it away, fortunately I had God and my family and my country behind me, but not everybody gets to feel that. You lose that compass, right. Whenever you get out people don't care. They don't care. Everybody loves you and they pat you on the back but who is going to pay the bills? So when you get out you don't know where that compass is spinning. I challenge you to find a veteran or someone that has a better work ethic, better dedication than a veteran.

But when that compass is spinning that's when insecurity builds in, that insecurity instantly becomes sadness because you're sad that you got the boo boo, that's what I call the boo-boo, I rarely bring it out only at home. You get that out and it instantly becomes depression, you know, man, I suck at life, I can't even pay my bills, I don't get a paycheck on the first and 15th. That four walls becomes a prison. That's how it happens. I want to punch that in the mouth. I want to punch 22 vets who committed suicide in the mouth, and the way that I do that absolutely, and I want to speak specifically to veterans right now, if you're having that problem, that life sucks, right. Because you're the one leg at her know like it or whatever just a civilian now which it is kind of were being a civilian, I go, ah, got a weird feeling to its.

But you see that compass spinning you don't know what to do, we start getting sad, you need to tell yourself that you owe it to the fallen to live well. And think about that. All right.

(APPLAUSE)

I have over 30 names that are embroidered into my center console, and it's not because I think it's cool to see a lot of names, it's because I knew every single one of those names, they are dead now. And I have to stomach that. The military, the Green Berets they teach us how to deal death but not deal with it. And I'm not saying that needs to be the mission, they need to be older move and communicate and do the great things that we do, however that's something that we don't have the coping mechanism and 35th time that you get that call and say, hey, Brian got it. Or Aaron Blagio is no longer with us. Or even worse what if you are stateside and you see that casket being lowered with that American flag down and his family is there with his wife, three month baby that he hadn't even met looking at you, so you say I'm sorry?

What do you say to that? It's impossible to actually make a statement to say, sorry for your loss. Here's how you do that. You live well for the fallen, that's a debt that you owe. If your life sucks, they win. Right? If your life sucks, they win. And something that you cannot let happen. So whenever you get that feeling that it's over -- hey, guy's sleeping over there, there you go, I got you boy. What, I've been on TV, hold me up, hey, I'm just saying. But whenever you get that feeling of hopelessness or that feeling of sadness, remember, you owe it to them to live well. And that's the best middle finger that you can give the Taliban used to live great and live awesome.

(APPLAUSE)

So to remind myself every single day I wear this ring right here as a symbol of 22 vet suicides every single day and I want to bring up Jacob Schick and Jeff Powell, two great friends of mine, there we go, come up there sugar.

(APPLAUSE)

Jake is the Executive Director of the 22 Kill Project and that's what he is absolutely, that's why he breathes air is to punch 22 vets committing suicide in the mouth. And so I want to let him talk to you all about the 22 Kill ring and we are going to present one to Mr. Trump tonight.

JACOB SCHICK: So much of America, John Wayne, so much American love it. I can't say it sorry, brother. So we wear these honor rings I am blessed to be part of a great organization to fight the staggering statistics that 22 warriors by suicide every day. Not only do we lose them on the battlefield but we lose when they come by their own hand. On average it's 22 a day. All three of us, where all war fighters, and we've all buried brothers and it's unacceptable. So what 22kill. com we fight like hell every day to end that statistic and let these warriors know and their families know you are worth it. Keep fighting the good fight. People wonder why we are the best military in the world, I'll tell you why, because it's one team, one fight. We are all in it together.

And that is how we are going to end this statistic. So we wear these honor rings on our trigger fingers for a reason, it's not a fashion thing, it's a life thing. Because this life is absolutely worth living.

(APPLAUSE)

So we are so proud to be here and honored to be here, and I've only met Mr. Trump a short time and his family, but two of my brothers know him a lot longer than I have, and I will tell you right now are word it's gold. So if they say it, it's so.

(APPLAUSE)

And with that these honor rings mean so much to us because it's silent salute to those served and/or serving, and to highlight the fact we lose 22 of her finest everyday by their own hand. And together we can crush that. We can stop.

(APPLAUSE)

So with that before we do this presentation, I feel like it would be remiss if I didn't say to all those in the audience tonight who served in the family members who went through those deployments with them, thank you, thank you for being there and thank you for what you did.

(APPLAUSE)

Into our Vietnam veterans, welcome home. Welcome home.

(APPLAUSE)

And with that I would like one of my best friends and fellow Marine -- generally, were better -- to present Mr. Trump with this personal honor ring that we brought for you, and we hope that you wear it with pride and remember that one team-one fight aspect, so we can make America great again together, brother.

(APPLAUSE)

DONALD TRUMP: That was amazing. Isn't that better than this debate that's going on, right. They're all sleeping, they're all sleeping, everybody. You know I see two of my friends in the audience and they become very famous and very rich, come on Diamond and Silk, get up here for a second. Diamond and Silk, these two are unbelievable. Melania called me, she said, you know there is somebody that is so amazing came here, you have to see this, I came I watch these two incredible women, these two beautiful women and they were going rapid back-and-forth. Never ends.

(APPLAUSE)

Mercy.

All right, thank you, I don't know. You know I really believe we took them into a room and just talk to them it would be fine. They would understand. We want strength, we want good healthcare, we want protection, we want borders, we want the wall, we want the wall. But if we could sit with them for about 10 minutes maybe, maybe they'd understand. Say, hello.

UNIDENTIFIED: How you all doing? And you know it really amazes me how people from the other camp want to come in here and mess up our stuff because their stuff is boring. But we all know that Donald J Trump is going to make America great again, don't we? Yes. Now we know this is not a rally that this is for our veterans but I want you it is imperative that you get out and caucus for Donald J Trump and vote for Donald J Trump.

(APPLAUSE)

And see why they are on the other side debating, we got a negotiator and a job creator right here.

(APPLAUSE)

And it is up to all of us to help Donald J. Trump make America great again.

(APPLAUSE)

DONALD TRUMP: I'll tell you what, they are something, those two. Right? Was it something? They've become a sensation all over the Internet, all over everything and we really appreciate it. So just to sum up we have an amazing country, we need strong leadership, we need compassionate leadership, we have to take care of our healthcare, we have to take care of our borders, we have to make our military so strong, so big, so powerful that nobody messes with us. We are never going to have to use it. We want nobody, nobody to mess with us.

All over and I tell the story all the time, I see are general they are always on talk shows, the retiring and even when they're not, they are talking about where the enemy is, I don't want journals that talk, I want generals and so do you folks, I want generals that have action. I want Gen. George Patton, we want Gen. MacArthur, we want generals we want people that are going to keep us safe.

So I just say this we are a country that doesn't win anymore, we don't win anymore. When was the last time we won? We don't win on trade. We don't win on the military. We don't beat ISIS. We don't do anything, we're not good, we are just not the same place. We are going to win so much. We are going to win at the military, we are going to win at the border, we are going to win on trade, we're going to get rid of Obamacare and come up with great, great powerful, wonderful healthcare.

We are going to win again, I tell you what, we're going to win again, we're going to win at every single level. And we are not to be laughed out throughout the rest of the world because believe me they laugh at our stupidity, they cannot believe what's happening. We send weapons over to our allies, a gun is fired into the air, they hear one sound of the bullet, they drop the weapons, the enemy takes them and now people come back from the Middle East and they tell me, Mr. Trump, they have better weapons than we do, they have the new versions, they have the best weapons, the enemy. Not going to happen anymore. It's not going to happen anymore, I will tell you.

So this is a special night for me and I had no idea this was going to happen, we started out literally 24 hours ago maybe less, we had no idea and we went out. We set up the website, I called some friends. And we just cracked, the sign was just given. We just cracked $6 million, $6 million.

And we have outside a list of the organizations and folks that are going to be getting this money, were going to divided up into going to get a lot of money, everybody's going to get a lot of money, and they are really great and we watched it. We were very careful in selecting because the costs are down, but the people are really doing good with the heart, the heart is so important and we have picked out some really amazing, amazing veterans organizations.

So this is turned out to be a much different evening, I thought this would be small I didn't even know if it was going to happen, and it turned out to be a phenomenal, a phenomenal night. I've gotten to meet some incredible veterans, I've gotten to meet John Wayne and your friends, and they are something, I'm not going to mess with them, OK. And I want to thank my entire family, I'll tell you, Vanessa and Don and Jared, big success, right, Don, Jared, he's doing good. And Ivanka is going to have a baby in two weeks, in fact we have a hospital all lined up and you know what I'm doing great, I love the people of Iowa but I said, Ivanka, it would be so great if you had your baby in Iowa. It would be so great, I would definitely win.

Stand up honey say hello, say hello.

(APPLAUSE)

Oh, I want that to happen. I want that to happen so badly, and Lara and my boy, Eric, who has just been fantastic, and my staff, it's just been great, and again, thank you sir for the $1 million and I'll tell you what, special guy and we love them. So just end, an amazing evening, you veterans are incredible people, brave beyond comprehension. And I just want to on behalf of your body in this country, in Iowa but in this country, I want to thank you for the job you do, because without you we would not be here tonight. Thank you all very much. Fantastic people, thank you everybody. Thank you very much.

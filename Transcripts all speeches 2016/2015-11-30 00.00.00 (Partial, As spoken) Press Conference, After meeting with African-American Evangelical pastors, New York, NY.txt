DONALD TRUMP: I thought it was an absolutely amazing -- you know, it lasted for two and a half hours. But we came up with lots of good ideas and lots of future ideas. But I thought it was an amazing meeting.

UNIDENTIFIED: And how did you -- how did you address some of the concerns that were raised?

DONALD TRUMP: Well, I think we'll be addressing them over the coming months and even over the coming years. I mean, these are deep seeded difficulties that certain communities have. And we're going to address them.

And certainly, if I'm put in a position where I can do something about them, which in this case happens to be president, we will be working very, very closely with everybody and we're going the be solving a lot of problems.

Right now, you have black youth. If you look at African-American youth where it's 51 and 55 and 57 percent unemployed, you have African- American people of different ages where it's double and triple other numbers.

So, we're looking at a lot of different things, but this meeting was amazing. Amazing people. We must have had close to a hundred people in the room. And I just want to thank you. I want to thank both of you and, and in particular, I'll tell you what, it's been -- there's a whole group of people standing behind me. You can't see him.

Because we actually didn't think we were going to be having a press conference. But we all thought it was such a good meeting we would do that and we had many, many endorsements that came out of the meeting.

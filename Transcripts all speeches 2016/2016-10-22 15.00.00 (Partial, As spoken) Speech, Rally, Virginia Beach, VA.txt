DONALD TRUMP: But we also need smart strategy. WikiLeaks shows that John Podesta said of Hillary, she has bad instincts. Now, we knew that. Just look at her career. One of her close allies said she doesn't seem to know what the planet and what planet we're living in. Look at her record...

This is a great, great movement. This is a movement, seriously, like they have never seen before in this country. We are driving them crazy. WikiLeaks even shows the Clinton Campaign speaking with contempt about Catholics and Evangelicals and then boasting gleefully about very friendly and malleable reporters who shower the Clintons with praise for no reason.

Our system is rigged, and I've been saying it for a long time. And the best evidence is that Hillary Clinton is even allowed to run for the Presidency of the United States in the first place.

But to be the country, and to be country of wealth, we must also be a safe country. National security begins at the border. Speaking in secret to a foreign bank, Hillary Clinton said her dream is for a totally open trade -- there go your businesses -- and open borders -- there goes your country. You lose your businesses and your country.

Anyone who supports open borders can never be the President of the United States. You will not have a country left. Open borders would be the end of the United States, believe me, as we know it.

(BREAK)

Our campaign is powered by our love for this country and our love for our citizens. It's a campaign about rejecting the cynicism and elitism of our failed political establishment. I'm gonna fight for every citizen of every background from every stretch of this nation.

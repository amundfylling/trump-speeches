JONATHAN KARL: And Trump himself surprised the political world when he Tweeted that he's going to meet with the NRA, quote, "about not allowing people on the terrorist watch list or the no fly list to buy guns."

I talked to Trump back stage at his rally about what he plans to tell the NRA.

DONALD TRUMP: And I want to just find out their thinking, because what I want -- and I know what they want, they want it as much as anybody in the world, they want to make sure that terrorists don't get guns and I know that something really good is going to come out of all this.

JONATHAN KARL: But is it your position that if you're on that terror watch list, if you're on that no fly list, you should not be able to buy a gun?

DONALD TRUMP: I'd like to see that and I'd like to say it and it's simpler. It's just simpler. Now, but what they say -- and I understand that, also -- is the Second Amendment, they're depriving them of those rights and that it could be that people are on there that shouldn't be on, you know, etc. Etc.

So we have to make sure that people that are terrorists or have even an inclination toward terrorism

JONATHAN KARL: Right.

DONALD TRUMP: -- cannot buy weapons, guns.

JONATHAN KARL: Could you get the N -- the NRA to budge on this, because they've had a firm -- they're against this idea.

DONALD TRUMP: Well, I...

JONATHAN KARL: And I -- and you -- and you're obviously pro-Second Amendment. Nobody doubts that.

DONALD TRUMP: Pro-Second Amendment...

JONATHAN KARL: So maybe...

DONALD TRUMP: And a pro-NRA. And, you know, they gave me, I think, the earliest endorsement they've ever given to anybody.

JONATHAN KARL: Yes.

DONALD TRUMP: I'll talk to them. And by the way, they have, I understand exactly what they're saying. You know, a lot of people are on the list that -- that really maybe shouldn't be on the list. And, you know, their rights are being taken away. So I understand that.

KARL (VOICE-OVER): And what about the Orlando shooter, who had previously been under surveillance by the FBI for nearly a year, but was still able to buy the guns he used in the attack?

(ON CAMERA): Doesn't that mean to you that something's wrong INAUDIBLE...

And remember this, he was licensed, you know, for all those people to say you have to go through all this. But he was licensed and he got a gun. I mean and he was...

JONATHAN KARL: Yes, so how do you change that...

DONALD TRUMP: -- he was...

JONATHAN KARL: -- law so that somebody like that can't get a gun?

DONALD TRUMP: We have to be vigilant. We have to be tough. We have to be strong. If you look at his career, I mean it's all -- even going to high school, going to early high school...

JONATHAN KARL: Yes.

DONALD TRUMP: -- I mean this guy was a -- he was a bad dude.

JONATHAN KARL: OK, so how...

DONALD TRUMP: He was a bad dude. I mean look, will somebody slip through?

Yes. You have a problem. You have to report these people. And everybody knew this guy had a problem. Now, in one case they did report it. I guess the gun store owner reported him and the authorities didn't act on it. What a shame.

JONATHAN KARL: So what does that say to you?

DONALD TRUMP: It says very sad, that's what it says. I mean to me, it says very sad. But they actually did report him and the authorities didn't act. And I think it's very unusual. And I'm a big fan of the FBI, but they had a little bit of a bad day.

DONALD TRUMP: We had a big day today. Today was the day where we hit the 1,237, right, 1,237.

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

And you know, you heard our president say, he will not be the nominee of his party. Oh, really? He's been right about that, like he's right about everything else, which is never!

Who would have thought? This wasn't supposed to happen. It was supposed to be that Trump would go to the convention. We were going to have a horrible convention because it was going to be contentious. I never believed that because I always said I was going to win on the first ballot.

When you have the Syrian refugees and you look at what's going on with the migration -- you have the Syrian refugees, and they're pouring into this country. They're pouring in all over Europe. Europe has this -- tremendous problems, and that's their problem, OK? We don't need to have any more problems. We have enough.

So here's my notes. Look, that's my notes. Don't you like it when somebody doesn't use a teleprompter, right?

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

Right? Here's my notes. Who else makes a speech to a crowd like this with this?

It's going to be a big wall. It's going to be a beautiful wall. Someday, when I'm gonzo (PH), maybe they'll name it after Trump. I'd really much rather have a statute in Washington, D.C. I don't want a wall named after me, but that's OK. I want a statue in Washington, D.C.!

(BREAK)

I don't want winner take all. And then they did a poll, Trump 48, they were 15 and 12. I said, That must be a wrong poll -- governor, senate (PH). So they did another poll. And then they -- I'm going win in, like, a landslide, and they tried to change it back, but we wouldn't let them, and we won all 99 delegates in the state of Florida.

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

Pretty good, right? So sometimes, the system is rigged. But sometimes, because we're dealing with some pretty strange people, sometimes it works out to your advantage.

Now, let me just tell you just in closing. We have to win because if we don't win, number, one you're not going to have your 2nd Amendment anymore. It's going to be so watered down, it's going to be the same thing. They're talking about bullets. They're talking about magazines. They're talking about things that you wouldn't even think about.

But here's what we're going to do. I submitted a list of 11 judges approved by Federalist Society, looked over by Heritage. We've gotten rave reviews on these judges. And I'm going to pick one of these judges, or somebody very close, and I'm going to actually add a few more to it because I hear there are some excellent extra, like, people that are great.

So we're going to have 14, 15 judges that are phenomenal, that believe in all of the things we believe in, and very, very strong on the 2nd Amendment. They're pro-life. They're strong on the 2nd Amendment. They're highly, highly vetted -- highly vetted.

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

And (INAUDIBLE) and I want to give it to a woman. Woman. You are the one. Where is that woman? You -- you -- all right, give it to her. She was something. So I never INAUDIBLE you know, I -- it actually fell on my foot, and it felt, like, heavy. That's the heaviest hat I've ever -- that means it was made in America. It's high quality. It is actually made in America.

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

So if we don't win, you're going to have potentially five judges. You're going to have a minimum of three during this term. This is an unusual term because it could be a record for -- in four years, for the number of Supreme Court justices I'm going to pick. So it could very well be. I mean, it's going to be incredible, the numbers. I like that. I like that.

Look at that! People -- look at that!

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

Look at that! I'm not sure if the people standing behind you like it, but we like it, right?

So what happens is the Supreme Court justices -- outside of security -- and the economy is very important, but the economy isn't even as important as this because if they put the judges that a Crooked Hillary Clinton will put onto the Supreme Court, your country will never be the same, will probably never recover. And if it does recover, it will be in 100 years from now. That's how serious it is.

MARK HALPERIN: I want to start by talking about the pope. There is a big debate in the Republican Party now about what role things he says should play. You've spoken favorably about him. He is talking this week about the environment.

Should a potential president listen to what the pope says about global warming?

DONALD TRUMP: Well, I'm not so sure. Look, I have a lot of respect for him. I think he's really a terrific person. I love his stance. He's so different. He's very refreshing. But I think you want to listen to science. You want to listen maybe to your own gut, maybe your own experience.

I'm not sure you have to necessarily listen to the pope as to the environment. It was a little bit of an unusual situation. So I wouldn't say so.

MARK HALPERIN: Do you agree with the point that -- the position he's taking, which is that the earth is getting warmer? Do you agree with that?

DONALD TRUMP: Well, I'm not a big believer in the whole global warming phenomena, OK? I'm not a person that, as you probably -- you know very well, my attitude is that, and I feel very strongly about this, clean air is so important.

MARK HALPERIN: But just on the factual question. You don't think human behavior is contributing to a dangerously warmer planet?

DONALD TRUMP: There could be a little bit of something having to do with factories and smoke and things. But for the most part I'm not a believer in that, yes. And I would say this also. Our country is cleaning up. And then you look at China and other countries, and they're not cleaning up.

And, you know, why aren't they doing it?

JOHN HEILEMANN: There's an important Republican interest group that you, I know, are familiar with, the Club for Growth.

DONALD TRUMP: Yes.

JOHN HEILEMANN: This morning they issued a statement saying that you should not be taken seriously as a presidential candidate. They cited a number of things that they have problems with. I'm going to ask you about two of them.

DONALD TRUMP: Sure.

JOHN HEILEMANN: One is they say that you are a protectionist. You said yesterday in your speech that you are a free trader. They point out that you have advocated a 25 percent tariff on Chinese imports.

How can you claim to be a free trader and be for a 25 percent tariff on Chinese imports?

DONALD TRUMP: Well, first of all, the Club for Growth was -- actually, John, they came up to see me very recently, in fact, Cory was here. And they sent us a letter, I think we have it, asking for a tremendous contribution.

That's interesting. I was shocked by the amount of money we're talking about. So that was wonderful.

Second of all, I do believe in free trade, but only if you have smart leaders. And with China, it's not free trade. We don't have free trade with China.

I love free trade. But it has got to be free trade and it has got to be fair trade. It has got to be where everything is equal. It's not equal.

MARK HALPERIN: People are really interested in your personality. A lot of people, I think you've heard this, think you're arrogant or too confident. Some people say you're hopelessly insecure, and that's why you act the way you do.

Are you insecure about anything?

DONALD TRUMP: I don't know. Maybe it's a combination of both.

MARK HALPERIN: Are you insecure?

DONALD TRUMP: Everyone is insecure.

MARK HALPERIN: What are you insecure about? Your looks? Your personality? Whether people like you?

DONALD TRUMP: I don't know. I mean, I don't think of myself as insecure, probably we're all insecure. You know, maybe insecurity is what makes you successful.

MARK HALPERIN: But be introspective, what are you insecure about?

DONALD TRUMP: Well, it is my hair.

MARK HALPERIN: Yes, we love your hair.

DONALD TRUMP: Like it or not, that's OK.

MARK HALPERIN: So what are you insecure...

DONALD TRUMP: Better than most.

MARK HALPERIN: What are you insecure about?

DONALD TRUMP: My chipping.

(LAUGHTER)

MARK HALPERIN: In golf.

DONALD TRUMP: My chipping, right.

Look, it's not a question of insecurity. I feel very confident. I went to the Wharton School of Finance. I was a good student. It's like one of the hardest schools in the world to get into.

I then do a book called "The Art of the Deal." It's the number one selling business book of all time, or just about. You may say, oh, there was one that sold -- but, you know, just about. It's still in schools and everything else.

I then do a show called The Apprentice. In the meantime I build this incredible empire. It has got a tremendous net worth, very little debt. And then I hear some pundit or some person say, he doesn't deserve to be on the stage with a senator.

A senator is nothing, and I'm not saying -- or senators are nothing, I'm saying certain people are zeroes, and I'm not supposed to be on the stage with these people? I mean, give me a break.

MARK HALPERIN: Because you've never run before, most of the people in this race have, people are wondering how you're going to conduct yourself. I just want to see about a couple of things...

(CROSSTALK)

DONALD TRUMP: I don't know.

MARK HALPERIN: Will you run negative television ads against your opponents as is common in politics?

DONALD TRUMP: I don't see it. You know, I'm not so sure I'm going to do that many ads. People know what I am and they know who I am. I'm a very -- you know, I've been acknowledged.

Business Week had a story and they said -- I guess a poll of their readers, and they rated me the best negotiator. So I don't say I'm...

(CROSSTALK)

MARK HALPERIN: But let me pin you down...

(CROSSTALK)

DONALD TRUMP: Go ahead.

MARK HALPERIN: You said, you don't see it. Will you run negative television ads against other Republicans?

DONALD TRUMP: I might.

MARK HALPERIN: You might.

DONALD TRUMP: I might. I don't know that I will. But I might.

MARK HALPERIN: And if you did, what would be off-limits, what wouldn't be off-limits? Would you just run them on policy?

DONALD TRUMP: Well...

MARK HALPERIN: Or might you run them on their...

DONALD TRUMP: No, I...

MARK HALPERIN: ... finances or their personal stuff?

DONALD TRUMP: I wouldn't do personal. No, I wouldn't do personal. I would probably do policy. I would probably do maybe the past. You know, I've had a very good past. I've had great success.

MARK HALPERIN: You have been critical, for instance, of Jeb Bush on Common Core and immigration.

DONALD TRUMP: I am very critical.

MARK HALPERIN: Could you imagine running negative ads against him on that?

DONALD TRUMP: I could see that. I don't know that I would do the...

(CROSSTALK)

MARK HALPERIN: People for years doubted how rich you are. And you were right. You know, you...

(CROSSTALK)

DONALD TRUMP: Much richer than...

(CROSSTALK)

MARK HALPERIN: Than they thought.

DONALD TRUMP: Yes.

MARK HALPERIN: People want to know. How much of your own personal wealth will you spend on this campaign?

DONALD TRUMP: Well, that's a great question. I mean, it depends. Look, I'm an intelligent person. I would say that it could be that my campaign doesn't resonate. And I'll call you guys and I'll say, John, Mark, it's not working.

I'm not so proud -- I'm proud but I'm not so proud. And I'm certainly not stupid. And it could be that it's not resonating. Right now I think it's resonating better than anybody ever thought possible.

You look at Facebook, you look at all of the things that has happened. I just went -- they just had over 3 million in Twitter, I was just informed. You know, I have a very...

MARK HALPERIN: But there are people less wealthy than you who have spent tens of millions of dollars...

JOHN HEILEMANN: Mitt Romney, for one.

MARK HALPERIN: Mitt Romney. Will you spend -- if it's going well...

DONALD TRUMP: Oh, I'm going to spend millions. Oh, I'm going to spend many millions.

MARK HALPERIN: Ten million?

DONALD TRUMP: Well, I will be up to tens of millions in the not-too-distant future. It's very expensive running a campaign. Now the advantage is I have an automatic air force. In fact, there's one of my planes, right? I have a nice air force. (INAUDIBLE).

But I actually save money, because all I have to do, I have to pay for the fuel, you know, it's sort of cheaper. It's actually cheaper than renting planes.

But, no, I expect to spend tens of millions of dollars. I'm also a business person, instinctively, I'm a business person, regardless of the kind of numbers you have seen, because I have far more money than Bush.

You know, they're saying Bush raised a lot of money, although less than they thought. I've raised more money than anybody by a factor of many, many times. But I'm not -- because I'm, you know, instinctively a good business person, I'm not going to throw money away.

If I think I can't win, I'm going to call you guys and say, fellows, I think I did a pretty good job...

MARK HALPERIN: Are you committed to going all the way through Iowa?

DONALD TRUMP: I would be totally committed unless I see for some reason I'm not going to win. I do believe in polls. You know, I had a good poll in New Hampshire the other day. And, again, it will be very interesting to see after this because most of my negativity in polls is because people think I'm not going to run.

They say, you're not going to run. And who is going to vote for somebody they think -- they really don't think I'm going to run?

Now they're all thinking, wow, he's actually running. But we had before this -- before yesterday we had a -- I guess we were in third or fourth place in New Hampshire. And I haven't done anything yet.

So, yes, I'm committed to go all the way. But, again, if, for some reason, it's not working out, what's the purpose?

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

JOHN HEILEMANN: In the past you have expressed a view that the way to deal with the war on drugs is to legalize drugs. Are you still in favor of legalizing drugs?

DONALD TRUMP: Well, you know, I see so many things. I look at the Colorado situation with the marijuana. It's very interesting because over the last little while a lot of bad things are happening up there with respect to people's health and the effect that it's having on people.

I am not in favor of the legalization of drugs.

JOHN HEILEMANN: So you're no longer holding that position. You've changed your mind?

DONALD TRUMP: Well, I don't know if I've ever -- I don't know if I was ever. I mean, I'm...

(CROSSTALK)

JOHN HEILEMANN: When you came out we thought that you were in favor of legalizing drugs.

DONALD TRUMP: Well, I mean...

JOHN HEILEMANN: It's OK to change your mind.

DONALD TRUMP: There are a lot of people -- that's true. And I've changed my mind on different things. But there are a lot of people -- I don't know that I've ever said that. But I will take your word for it. I would say generally speaking, just sitting here right now, they're a terrible thing. And probably I would not be in favor of the legalization of drugs.

But, you know, there are two sides to it. The one thing is you would clean up the whole thing and you do -- but it really is a -- I look at what's happening to the inner cities. I look at what drugs are doing to -- it's so bad.

And there are some great people. I have some very conservative friends that are totally in favor of legalization of drugs. And I have some that are totally against it. Probably I am inclined to go against.

MARK HALPERIN: You have suggested that Governor Bush, Senator Rubio, Senator Santorum, Carly Fiorina, are all losers, people who shouldn't win and can't win.

DONALD TRUMP: Well, I don't think I used that name.

MARK HALPERIN: You did about some of them.

DONALD TRUMP: I did?

MARK HALPERIN: But -- yes, I think so. But you have suggested all of them either shouldn't be running or won't win because of things they have done or positions they've had. So I'm just wondering whether -- who in the race do you respect?

Who do you think has a good chance to win besides you?

DONALD TRUMP: Well, I'd rather not too much say, because, you know, I don't want to build up people that I'm supposed to be running against.

MARK HALPERIN: But Scott Walker, for instance. He has got a good...

DONALD TRUMP: Well, he came up to my office a few weeks ago, gave me a beautiful trophy, which is upstairs. If you'd like, I'd show it to you. Gave me a beautiful plaque, because I helped him, actually.

But he has got a lot of problems in Wisconsin. You know, Wisconsin has got tremendous problems. I like him.

MARK HALPERIN: What problems are you talking about?

DONALD TRUMP: The debt and the difficult problems that they have going on in Wisconsin that a lot of people don't understand and know about. Tremendous borrowings. And they have difficulties.

MARK HALPERIN: So is there anybody in the field you look at and say, boy, that person has got a great record, they are really formidable?

DONALD TRUMP: Well, you mentioned four. I mean, Carly Fiorina, who I don't know, I don't think I've ever met her, she was viciously fired, viciously. This wasn't like a normal fire. The reason I know about it, because, you know, it's not my world, but she was viciously fired...

MARK HALPERIN: You know something about firing people though.

DONALD TRUMP: I do. I'm very good at firing people. But I don't like firing people, actually. People don't know that, I really don't like firing people, except if it's on The Apprentice.

But Carly Fiorina was viciously fired from Hewlett-Packard, walked out, and then ran against Barbara Boxer and lost in a landslide.

MARK HALPERIN: So there's another person...

DONALD TRUMP: And then you say -- well wait, and then you say, oh, that's OK, now I will run for president. I don't like that.

Rick, who I really have gotten to know, he has come up to see me twice in the last couple of months.

MARK HALPERIN: Santorum.

DONALD TRUMP: And he is really a nice guy, Rick Santorum. But I tell him, I say, look, you were a sitting senator in Pennsylvania. You lost by 19 points, which is like a record. And now you say, OK, I lost by the -- in the history of the Senate, I think, they said for, you know, a sitting senator, lost by a record, 19 points. Now you say, OK, now I'm going to run for president.

MARK HALPERIN: What about Rick Perry and Mike Huckabee? You know both of them. Are they good candidates?

DONALD TRUMP: Well, Rick Perry, I thought he had really bad run last time. And you know what, I don't know him well, but I had dinner with him once or twice. And he is really a fine person. And I like him a lot.

But, boy, that's a tough deal. He had a rough time. And I think he is going to have a hard time getting over that. And I'm not just talking about the "oops," I'm talking about I think he's going to have a really tough time getting over that.

I like Mike Huckabee a lot. I did his show. I don't know that his show would have continued much longer, unlike The Apprentice.

JOHN HEILEMANN: We were sitting there yesterday as you came in, made your entrance, came down the escalators there. I was enjoying listening to Neil Young, love that song, love that performer, but I did think to myself, you know, I wonder what Neil Young is going to think, he's pretty liberal, I'm not sure he's...

DONALD TRUMP: He is.

JOHN HEILEMANN: I'm not sure he's going to love this...

DONALD TRUMP: Do you know he is a friend of mine?

JOHN HEILEMANN: ... use of the song. So what did you think when he came out very quickly and said, please don't use my song, Donald?

DONALD TRUMP: I fully understand it. He's a very liberal guy. And we actually, you know, have the rights to the song through whatever mechanism it is. But I wouldn't do it. You know, he called me -- I spoke to him two days ago. He called me up, it had nothing to do with the song.

He called me to say hello. I love Neil Young, and he loves me. We have a great relationship. But our politics are exactly the opposite. You know, he is on the other side.

JOHN HEILEMANN: So you are saying Neil Young calls you as a friend, but then when you used the song...

DONALD TRUMP: Well, he really did.

JOHN HEILEMANN: But then when you used the song he came out and said, Donald, don't use that song.

DONALD TRUMP: I went to see Neil Young last year, I think it was like Carnegie Hall.

JOHN HEILEMANN: Carnegie Hall, I was there.

DONALD TRUMP: And it was great.

JOHN HEILEMANN: Great.

DONALD TRUMP: I think he's fantastic. And he came up to my office after the -- he said, I saw you in the audience, I would love to meet you. And I said, absolutely. He came up to my office like whenever that was, a day after the Carnegie Hall.

I'm friendly with Neil. He called me two days ago just to say hello, nothing to do with the song. Then we put the song out, and, you know, along with many other songs, it was background. Basically it was background music.

But we put the song on. It wasn't Neil. Neil's manager called and he said to my -- Neil really likes Donald Trump, but would it be possible for him not to -- because Neil's politics are very different. And I heard that and I said, absolutely.

JOHN HEILEMANN: He is endorsing Bernie Sanders, which is not like a...

DONALD TRUMP: That's true.

JOHN HEILEMANN: Not really your politics.

DONALD TRUMP: Who, by the way, is doing very well. Bernie Sanders is doing very well.

MARK HALPERIN: Last question, keying off your Atlantic City roots.

DONALD TRUMP: Right.

MARK HALPERIN: What are the odds that Donald Trump will be the next president of the United States?

DONALD TRUMP: I asked that question to a lot people. What do you think? What do you think? A lot of people are saying, we're going to get -- look...

MARK HALPERIN: Give me some odds.

DONALD TRUMP: We're doing -- well, I'm running against political people that do it all their lives. I've never done this before. I don't do this.

MARK HALPERIN: Fifty to one?

DONALD TRUMP: I would say anywhere from 10 to 20 percent.

MARK HALPERIN: Ten to 20 percent.

DONALD TRUMP: I mean, I think. I think from 10 to 20 percent.

MARK HALPERIN: So you are an underdog. The first time in a long time you have been an underdog.

DONALD TRUMP: Well, no. I've probably been when my father said, don't go into Manhattan, don't go in.

(CROSSTALK)

MARK HALPERIN: That was a long time ago.

DONALD TRUMP: That was a long time ago. When I did The Apprentice  they all said, Trump -- I'll never forget, I read a critic. And the critic said, before the show went on, the critic said, "Donald trump is doing a television show?" That was an underdog.

When I did book called The Art of the Deal, nobody thought it was going to be such a big book. It became one of the biggest. So I'm sort of -- you know, I consider myself many times an underdog.

JOHN HEILEMANN: But you are telling me if I can get 10-to-one odds, because you're saying five-to-one is like the worst...

DONALD TRUMP: Yes.

JOHN HEILEMANN: If I can get 10-to-one odds on you, I should make a bet?

DONALD TRUMP: I think you should...

(CROSSTALK)

JOHN HEILEMANN: I should go put some big...

(CROSSTALK)

Take those odds.

DONALD TRUMP: One thing I can tell you, I will be trying. And I always tell people, you know, I give speeches on success, and they say, would you speak on this or speak on that, or friends of mine come, can you speak to my son about what he should do?

Never ever quit. I don't quit.

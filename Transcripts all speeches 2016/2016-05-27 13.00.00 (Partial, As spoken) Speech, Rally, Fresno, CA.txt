DONALD TRUMP: My environmental standard is very simple. And I've said it to everybody. I want clean air and I want clean water. That's what I want.

(CHEERING)

Clean air, clean water. Very, very simple.

So we're going to be back up here. I believe me, we'll start opening up the water so that you can have your farmers survive --

(CHEERING)

-- so that your job market will get better.

(CHEERING)

No, but there are some things inconceivable, that, you know, they happen and you wonder why. I'm asking why, why, why, and nobody can explain why they do this. But they do it. Your Senators are for it, but they're totally ineffective, unfortunately.

(SHOUTING)

They're in effective. You know they're for it.

By the way, they are for you, and then to the other side, they're for it for them. And then you wonder, I wonder why nothing happens, but when you're with the Senators, they want you. And then go to the environmental side and they want them. And then you say, gee, that's strange. They're for me, we want the water, but the environmentalists just endorsed them, I wonder why. I'll tell you how it works, folks. So they play both sides of it. But they're actually not for you. So we'll see what happens. But we're going to get it done and done quick. Don't even think about it. That's an easy one. Don't even think about it.

(CHEERING)

So yesterday was a big day. You know, yesterday --

(CHEERING)

(CHANTING)

We're going to bring it back, folks. We're going to bring this country back. You know what it is? Look at those red hats, the hats, the black hats.

(CHEERING)

The gun-shooting hats. They do pretty well, I'll tell you.

Speaking of that, the NRA, last week, endorsed Donald Trump in the earliest endorsement they've ever given.

(CHEERING)

The earliest they've ever given. That was a great honor. And Wayne and Chris and all the guys, these are great people. These are great Americans. These are people that want to see great things for the country. They try to build them, like sort of a radical agenda. It's not a radical agenda. It's called the Second Amendment, folks.

(CHEERING)

Now Hillary Clinton wants to abolish the Second Amendment. Remember that.

(BOOING)

She wants to abolish it. And it's a disgrace. I watched her on television, and it's hard for me to watch her, because, honestly, it's very boring. You know, it's very boring.

(LAUGHTER)

But I watched her last night, and lies so much, and she was saying last night so many things. Donald Trump wants to see Japan get nuclear weapons. I never said that. Donald Trump wants to see Germany get nuclear weapons. He wants to see South Korea arm themselves. I said, I didn't say that. I never even said close to that. Donald Trump loves North Korea. He loves the maniac that's running North Korea. I don't. Donald Trump is a friend of Putin. Well, actually, Putin did call me a future of the Republican Party.

(CHEERING)

He's off to a good start.

(CHEERING)

I will say, I will say he's off to a good start, right, folks.

And by the way, I'm not a friend of Putin. I don't know Putin. I never met him. I respect Putin. He's a strong leader, I can tell you that, unlike what we have. We have a pathetic leader. Pathetic.

(CHEERING)

We don't even have a leader. The word "leader." You go "leader" in quotes, right, but we don't even have a leader. But wouldn't it be nice if we could get along with Russia? Wouldn't that be nice?

(CHEERING)

We spent almost $5 trillion in the Middle East. And we're in worse shape today in the Middle East than we were 15 years ago. If these presidents would have gone away on vacation and not done anything, we'd be in better shape than we are today, if you think about it.

(CHEERING)

I was against the war in Iraq, totally against the war in Iraq.

(BREAK)

But, and I loss a lot, you know, by doing this. Macy's turned out to be a total trader. Macy's head -- head of Macy's calls me up, "Donald, I'm very concerned." What. You know, I said we got to stop illegal immigration. And I have -- it's not a big deal, but I sell ties and shirts and stuff at Macy's, right? Big deal. Who cares? Lot of them were made in China so I didn't care anyway to be honest. Because you have no choice. They don't make things in here anymore. They're making it other countries. They don't make them here.

So, I called up and he goes, "Donald, I'm very concerned." I'm never figure out I was making a speech. I was in New Hampshire. I was getting ready and they're introducing me. And I'm starting to do well because as you know, I won New Hampshire. I'm getting ready to go up and make a speech. I'm standing like year on the stairs. And a nice guy is introducing me. There's over a thousand people which is a small crowd now, a thousand people, but in New Hampshire they have small venues. This was in somebody's backyard. The place was packed.

And I'm getting ready and the man saying, "and Donald Trump is the personification of the American dream." So, he's all the different things. And I got a call then I see it's the head of Macy's. Nice guy actually, Terry Lundgren. And I say, "Oh, well, I'll do this quick.. Hey, Terry, what's going on?" And he was a friend of mine. Haven't spoken to him since. I won't talk to him. He goes, "Donald, I'm so concerned." What? "I hear that they're going to picket Macy's." Who? "Some people we don't know. Donald, could I announce that we're dropping your line." I said, "Drop my line for what? Let him had the picket for half hour. Then they're going to want to go to launch. It happens all the time." "No, no, they going to picket". He was so afraid.

I said, "Terry, I'm going up to make a speech." "No, no, please, please, don't get off the phone, please. Could we talk about it?" And I'm saying to myself, "Can you believe this guy?" And this was a friend of mine. I said, "Terry, let him.'' "No, no, please.'' In meantime, ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Donald Trump and I'm on the phone, I can't get this guy off the phone. I said, "Can I call you back later." Yes, but I could do that? I said just a do whatever you want to do, I don't care. They canceled my shot ties and shirts and they were doing well. They cancelled my ties and shirts at Macy's.

So, you know, when I do -- and very disloyal. Honestly, we ought to boycott Macy's. I tell you what happened. I'll tell you what happened.

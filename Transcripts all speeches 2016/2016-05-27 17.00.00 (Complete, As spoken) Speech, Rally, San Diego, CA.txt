DONALD TRUMP: Oh, what a crowd. This is unbelievable. Unbelievable!

(APPLAUSE)

Come on!

(APPLAUSE)

Cameras, turn over here. Turn over here, cameras. You know they never want to show the crowds we get. This is a movement, folks. This is is a big, beautiful movement.

(APPLAUSE)

And no other Republican would say this, but we are going to play for California and we are going to win California. You watch. You watch.

(APPLAUSE)

Nobody else can get this. I want to thank everybody. Amazing. And I want to thank Sarah Palin and all of the people who came here on our behalf and the speeches that they made today. I really appreciate it. This is unbelievable. I don't know how big this room is, but this is a lot of people.

(APPLAUSE)

Thank you. So yesterday we had a very big day. You saw that, right? 1237. We reached it. Crooked Hillary cannot put Bernie away and we won over 17. We are going to win all the way. We are going to go all the way. We are going to make America great again. It's going to happen, going to happen.

(APPLAUSE)

I want to thank you very much. I love San Diego. I love the people of San Diego. I love our vets. Where are our vets?

(APPLAUSE)

We have Vets for Trump some place. Who are the Vets for Trump? Carrie! Hi, Carrie. Who are the Vets for Trump? Where are these guys? Can we get them up here? Get them up! We love our vets. Come on up here, fellas. Come on up.

Good looking guys. Oh, look at this guy. We got a lot of power here.

(APPLAUSE)

So, I got a call from Darryl a few weeks ago, long before people thought we'd be winning this so quickly. He said, "Donald, I endorse you 100 percent." And those are the people I remember. I like it.

So Darryl, thank you. Where's Darryl?

(APPLAUSE)

I appreciate it.

And Duncan (PH), thank you very much, right from the beginning. Duncan. You better vote for these guys forever. We're never letting them go. I'll tell you what, nobody like our vets, and we're going to cherish our vets. We're going to take care of our vets.

Now, I'm the only one this can happen to, but on Tuesday we're announcing, you know, when I skipped the speech with Fox -- and I like Fox, but they didn't treat me so well. I saw it in a little thing -- we'll give a speech. And then during the speech, a little before the speech, I said, "Maybe we can raise some money for the vets, " right?

So I said, "Well, we'll raise a half-million dollars." And then I said, "Maybe we can do more." We raised $1 million. And then a couple of my friends chipped in -- Stewart Roth (PH) from Las Vegas, and Carl Icahn and Stewart -- and we have so many different -- Bill Ruffin PH, Ike Perlmutter.

And these guys gave between a half-million and a million dollars, right? And I said, "Whoa, we're up to $3 million -- $3 million. Maybe we'll get it up to $4 million, maybe we'll get it up to $5 million. Maybe we'll get it up to $6 million."

And we raised like more than $5.5 million for the vets.

(APPLAUSE)

And I never got such bad publicity in my life. It's unbelievable. It's unbelievable.

So on Monday -- or Tuesday, we're releasing -- we give to many groups, many, many groups. And it's pretty close to $6 million that we raised. And it's for our vets and we love our vets, and there's nobody like our vets. And we're going to take care of our vets. We're going to build our military, by the way, bigger and better and stronger than ever before.

But a big part of that is we are going to take care of our vets for the first time in a long time. We love our vets.

Thank you very much, fellows. Thank you. We appreciate it. And he's not a vet, in case that even (INAUDIBLE).

Thank you, everybody. Thank you. Thank you, Darryl (PH). Thank you, Duncan.

We have a great vet, World War II. He looks like a young guy. They're all saying point him out. He's in the front row, and there he is.

(APPLAUSE)

Beautiful. Thank you. Thank you very much. Fantastic.

(APPLAUSE)

Women pilots, that's what I like.

(APPLAUSE)

Thank you.

So this has been amazing. This has been amazing. We -- we just left Fresno. We had a crowd that was, you know, just incredible. And really, we are going to win the state of California because people are tired. People are tired of the Hillary Clinton's of the world. It's all talk. It's no action. It's Crooked Hillary. It's the same stuff.

And our country cannot take another four years of Obama. That I can tell you. That's what you're going to be getting.

(APPLAUSE)

I mean, just take a look at the TSA. Take a look at what's going on at your airports. Take a look at what's going on with our military that we love. We can't beat ISIS. We're going to beat ISIS. We're going to beat them quickly. We're going to knock the hell out of them. We shouldn't have been there in the first place, but we're going to knock the hell out of them. And we have to rebuild our country.

We've spent $5 trillion in the Middle East, and right now we have absolutely nothing for it. If we wouldn't have spent 10 cents, we would have been better off, believe me. We're going to rebuild our country. We're going to rebuild our military. We are going to take care of our needs, including our vets, and we're going to bring it back, folks. We're going to bring it back, and it's going to happen quickly.

And we are going to build a wall. We're going to build a wall. We're going to build a wall. Latinos for Trump, I love you. You know? Build a wall.

(APPLAUSE)

Thank you. Thank you. We're going to build it, and if we don't build it, I'll get Papa Doug (PH) to build it. He'll get it up. You know who Papa Doug PH is; he's your big guy in town, folks. He's great. He's great and he employs a lot of people. A lot of jobs, a lot of education, a lot of health care. We love him. Thank you. Thank you.

So we've had an exciting time. When I started this journey on June 16th, not so long ago, almost a year, hard to believe -- you have to say, we've (PH) been on the cover of Time Magazine many, many times, and it's really about the movement because we've created a movement. It's a movement to common sense, to smart. We're not going to be ripped off anymore.

All right. Get him out of here. Get him out. Get him out.

(APPLAUSE) And somebody said, by the way, why are you going to San Diego? Why are you going to California? You already won the primaries. You don't have to go. And I said very simply, because I said I was going to go, I have to be here, right?

(APPLAUSE)

I love you. I love you. And I love San Diego. I have so many friends in San Diego. I love San Diego. And I really like when they put up Latinos for Trump. Latinos.

(APPLAUSE)

We're going to do great with the Latinos because I'm going to -- I'm bringing back jobs. The Latinos, African-Americans, we are doing great with African-Americans. They want jobs. We are losing our jobs to everybody. We are being taken advantage of by the world. We are losing our jobs to everybody. We are going to bring back jobs like we haven't seen in this country for many, many decades. And people that aren't doing well, they are going to start doing very, very well, believe me.

OK. So on June 16th, I came down the escalator with my wife Melania, and I said "Wow, this is going to be -- I have never seen, outside of the Academy Awards, the kind of press." But of course, look at what we have today. Mostly live cameras. Some of the most dishonest people in the universe. Some of the worst people.

Why don't you take those cameras and spin them around a little bit and show them? Why don't you take them? Spin them around. They don't want to do that, folks. They don't want to do it. That's why I love my protesters, because the only time and the only way they show how big our crowds are, the only time is when there is a protester because that's a negative thing, they think. But I love our protesters, right?

(APPLAUSE)

So I came down the escalator and I made a speech. And if you notice, that's my notes for the speech. We've got to go free form. We don't want teleprompters, right? No teleprompters. We ought to have a law that if you are running for president, you're not allowed to use teleprompters. It's too easy. Look what we got the last time. We got a teleprompter guy. We don't need that. We don't need that.

So I started talking about illegal immigration, a tremendous problem. I don't think this would be a problem that would even be discussed, frankly, if we didn't do it and put it as part of our campaign. And we talked about bad trade, really bad trade. We are losing $500 billion a year with China. We are losing $58 billion a year with Mexico. We are losing over $100 billion a year with Japan.

And every single country no matter what -- name a country -- we lose. We don't win anymore. We're going to start winning. We're going to win with trade. We're going to win with our military. We're going to start winning again. (APPLAUSE)

Now, our president is right now -- you're right. It's pathetic.

Honestly, folks, we have leadership right now in this country, especially at the top, that is grossly incompetent. They don't know what the hell they're doing. They don't know what they're doing.

So I saw he's in Japan in Hiroshima and that's fine, just as long as he doesn't apologize, it's absolutely fine. Who cares?

But he said today that our trading partners and countries that we have relationship with, they're rattled -- they're rattled. And I said, "Yay, oh, that's so good." And a very, very powerful guy, a very great guy -- I won't use his name -- but most of you know. I saw him last week. Knows everybody. Highly respected.

And he said, "Donald, I had no idea this was going to happen, but I'm being called by all of these countries -- Germany, Japan, Saudi Arabia." Think of it. We defend these countries and they don't pay us what they're supposed to be doing -- Germany, Saudi Arabia, Japan, South Korea, many others.

Then you look at the NATO countries -- 28 total, many of them aren't living up to their obligations. So, we have common sense. We have business ability. What happens is this. He said, "I can't believe it; I didn't like your rhetoric." And I happen to be a nice person, folks. I'll get along great. I will get along so great with these countries. I will get along so great.

But you know what? They're our friends. They're our allies. But they have been abusing us. They have been abusing us. This isn't 40 years ago when we could have done whatever we want. We owe $19 trillion. It's going up to $21 trillion because of the omnibus budget which was not so good. That's the budget that allows people to come in from Syria, people to cross the border, funds Obamacare which we shouldn't have done.

Because we will terminate Obamacare and replace it, believe me, with something good. Believe me.

(APPLAUSE)

Repeal and replace Obamacare.

So, this man said, "Donald, I can't believe it." And he's like the biggest of the big. He said, "I disagreed with your style. I really did. I disagreed. And yet now all of these countries are calling: How do we get along with Trump? We think he's going to win. What do we do? How do we do it? How do we do it?"

They're not going to take advantage of us -- no more, folks. We've had enough. No more. No more.

So, the press is dishonest. And what they say, and what I say is very different. I watched Hillary Clinton last night, which was hard to do because she's a very boring speaker.

(APPLAUSE)

And I will not say -- I will not say because it's not politically correct and it's not a nice thing to say, so I will not say that she shouts into the microphone and it drives everybody crazy. So I won't say that.

But I found it very hard to watch. And then she lies. Now, you know, I called somebody a liar, but I don't say that anymore because that person is now in the past. I say that person is in the past. And with Hillary, we say "Crooked Hillary."

But I've got to add another word because I never saw anything like this last night. She was saying that "I want Japan to arm with nuclear weapons." I never said that. She was saying, "I love the dictator in North Korea." I don't love the dictator -- bad guy, OK? Bad guy.

She was saying all sorts of things so bad, and so false, total lies. And we're not going to let her get away with it. We're not going to let her get away.

(APPLAUSE)

What I do say is this. We have tremendous deficits. We're losing a fortune. Our jobs picture is terrible. Don't believe the five percent. The real number is at least 20 percent. When you look for a job, and I can tell people -- raise their hands -- do you think I'd have an audience -- look at the size of this room, packed to every corner.

You know what? People -- and the polls love me on security. And there's nothing more important than our national security. They love me on certain things.

But honestly, we wouldn't have crowds like this, and it's everywhere we go. We wouldn't have crowds like this. They're as big as the room.

And by the way, there are thousands of people outside that can't get in. OK? And it's not like, you know, Friday afternoon. You could have been doing something else, I guess, right?

But we have fun. Are these the greatest places, the Trump rallies -- are they the greatest? All right?

(APPLAUSE)

The greatest.

So, and by the way, the safest place to be in this country is at a Trump rally. That I can tell you.

(APPLAUSE) And we're going to take care of everybody, not just the people in this room; not just what the people in this room represent, which is largely love, because it is love. But we're going to take care of everybody, including people that don't know if they like the people in this room.

Because we're going to unify our country. We're going to take care of the Hispanics. We're going get jobs. We're going to take care of the African Americans who are really suffering in this country. And Hillary Clinton can't do a damn thing for them and she never will.

And guess what? She doesn't want to. OK? She couldn't care less.

So -- so it's worked out beyond what we thought. We were supposed to be in July in Cleveland fighting for our lives. And I said, "What are you talking about? We're going to win on the first ballot; we're going to win on the first ballot." Right?

(APPLAUSE)

Now, I didn't know it was going to go this quickly. Oh, look at the cameras. They turned because they found a protester. Look at those cameras -- those bloodsuckers. They found a protester.

Thank you, protester. Thank you, protester. Thank you.

Get him out. Get him out.

(APPLAUSE)

Get him the hell out of here.

It's always funny. You can never -- usually they're just singles. You know, their mom kicked them out of the house for the week. But usually, they're singles. And you can never hear them. But what you hear is my people going, "Get them out, get them out." My people make so much noise. It's true. It's true.

(APPLAUSE)

So let me just tell you, Bernie Sanders has been great. We like Bernie. I like Bernie. You know why I like him? He doesn't have a chance and what he's doing to her is incredible.

(APPLAUSE)

Because the system is rigged against Bernie. Did you ever notice? He wins, he wins, he wins, he wins. Then you watch the pundits -- these guys, the dishonest ones. They sit around, "He can't win, " because the system is rigged.

I have to say, our system was rigged, too, except for one thing. If you win by massive landslides every week, it's no longer rigged. It's like the boxers -- right. That's what happened. The system was not meant for me to come in as an outsider that built a great company. I built a great, great company.

When I filed -- when I filed -- in fact, Papa Doug (PH) knows -- when I filed my papers, over 100 pages in federal elections, and I filed. Tremendous company. Tremendous iconic assets. Unbelievable cash flow. Very little debt. Makes a lot of money. And they were so unhappy to see it.

But you know what? I say it for a different reason. And I started up, by the way, with a million dollar loan and now have a net worth of much more than $10 billion. And you know what? I don't even want it.

I'll tell you what, all I want to say is this is the kind of thinking that we need to straighten out this mess that they've given us in our great country.

(APPLAUSE)

This is the thinking we need. This is what we need.

So let me tell you a little bit about San Diego, because we're talking about a rigged system, right? I have to say this. I was told, "Oh, (INAUDIBLE), don't do that; we're going to win." But San Diego is special for a lot of reasons. Some of my best friends live here. You may have the best weather on earth. OK? You may have. I've always heard it. I've always heard it.

But we have a couple of minutes. Does everybody have a little time?

(APPLAUSE)

So, I end up with a lawsuit. And it ends up in San Diego in federal court. And it's a disgrace the way the federal court is acting. Because it's a simple lawsuit. Everybody that took the so- called course -- it's Trump University -- is in San Diego.

And the trial -- they wanted it to start while I'm running for president. The trial is going to take place sometime in November. There should be no trial. This should have been dismissed on summary judgment easily.

Everybody says it, but I have a judge who is a hater of Donald Trump, a hater. He's a hater. His name is Gonzalo Curiel and he is not doing the right thing. And I figure what the hell? Why not talk about it for two minutes? Should I talk about it? Yes?

UNIDENTIFIED: (OFF-MIKE)

DONALD TRUMP: So we should have won. I'm being railroaded. So here's the story. Very simple story. A number of years ago, a long time ago now, I open up a little school. We called it Trump University, changed the name. We had probably -- I don't know, a lot of people, like 10,000 people. The people -- you, did you like it? She said she was there, she liked it. Here's the story. So we open up, and it really was successful from the beginning, then we get these class action lawyers. They immediately sue. My people did a good job for a couple of reasons. One of the reasons was they had everybody that took the course sign like a report card. So we had let's say 10,000 people. Almost that many signed their report card. And the report cards are unbelievable.

By the way, without that, it's their word versus these people or me. But I'm getting railroaded by a legal system that -- frankly, they should be ashamed because this is a case that -- I'll be here in November. Hey, if I win as president, it's a civil case. I could have settled this case numerous times.

But I don't want to settle cases when we're right. I don't believe in it. And when you start settling cases, do you know what happens? Everybody sues you because you get known as a settler. One thing about me, I am not known as the settler. And people understand that this whole thing, with this whole deal with the lawyers, class action lawyers are the worst. It's a scam.

So here's what happens. We're in front of a very hostile judge. The judge was appointed by Barack Obama, federal judge. Frankly, he should recuse (PH) himself because he's given us ruling after ruling after ruling, negative, negative, negative. I have a top lawyer who said he's never seen anything like this before.

So what happens is we get sued. We have a magistrate named William Gallo who truly hates us. And this is what? Now, the good news is it's a jury trial. But we can't even get a full jury. We're entitled to a jury. We want a jury of 12 people and you're going to watch. First of all, it should be dismissed before the trial, but if we have a trial, we'll go all the way. Watch how we win it because I have been treated unfairly. Very much like with the veterans, where I raised all that money, but on Tuesday, I'm announcing all of the groups that we've giving almost $6 million to.

You know, you turn things around. So here's the story. We have a law firm named Robin Skeller (PH) where basically, Robin Skeller's PH a spin-off of two law firms: Lyrichoclin PH and Milberg Weiss. Two of those partners went to jail for an extended period of time for doing very bad things illegally PH. This same group is the lawyers against.

So what happens is the judge, who happens to be, we believe, Mexican, which is great. I think that's fine. You know what? I think the Mexicans are going to end up loving Donald Trump when I give all these jobs, OK? I think they're going to end up -- I think they're going to love.

(APPLAUSE)

I think they're going to love me. So here's what happens. We get sued by a woman and she turns out to be a disaster for them. Her name is Tarla Makaeff and she rated on the report card -- it's one two five, five being excellent, the highest mark. She gave me a five across the board, all fives. She then did a video saying it was fantastic, the most glowing video you have ever seen. She then sued me because she wanted her money back.

She was such a disaster that this judge -- it was her against us. She was such a disaster that this judge allowed her to get out of the case. But we want her to be in the case. And the lawyer said, "Your honor, we want her to be in the case." He said she's out of the case. So now, we have others. So we said, "Dismiss the case. She's out of the case." "No, we won't dismiss the case."

So we have 10,000 surveys from former students giving Trump University rave reviews. It's called -- and it's on the website -- www.98percentapproval.com. OK?

Now, so we have Marla (PH) -- so we have Makoff PH giving us these great numbers. Then we have another one. Bob Bulow PH, they used him. I think it was Bush -- Jeb Bush, low energy. We have -- we have these guys making commercials.

Now look, in all fairness, it hasn't hurt me much. Because, you know, they use this thing and every once in a while you have one. And we're going to win. But if I don't win, and even if I do win, we want to open -- my kids will open it up again, because it was a terrific school. It was great. It was good.

So we have a guy named Bob Bulow (PH). He appeared in a TV attack ad. Do you believe it? They used him in ads against me. I had 66,000 negative ads, over $100 million. In Florida alone during the big primary, which I won in a landslide, we had 15,000 negative ads, and I won. I almost wonder what do ads mean, if you want to know the truth.

So you have this guy Bob Bulow (PH). He appeared in TV attack ads even though he rated the programs a five, meaning excellent, the top mark, across the board. His primary complaint was he would have liked to have more comfortable chairs. OK? Unbelievable.

Then we have a guy named Art Cohn, and he was late to file. So he signed a survey in which he rated the program either a four or a five. I will tell you this, how smart was it to ask everybody that took the course to sign a report card? OK?

Now, you know what the lawyers are saying? The lawyers are saying, "Oh, but they were forced; 10,000 people were forced; they were forced." And you have pictures. We actually have videotapes of people. They weren't forced. A professor said, "Would you sign how you like it?" So that's it.

So, he signed all fives and fours, out of a possible -- the highest marks. And indicated that his only complaint was the lack of nice lunch sandwiches. OK? Think of it.

So he was late. So they went to the judge and the judge said, "He's late; why don't you file under RICO, organized crime?" Now, we've all been sued in business for RICO, even Papa John probably. Were you ever sued? Everybody. RICO's like -- but they ended it pretty much. So I get sued. Here's a guy give me all good marks. He's late. So they're starting a new lawsuit. Now, here's the thing. This law firm, because this is like a life study. This law firm gave a lot of money to the attorney general of New York, who is a total lightweight. His name is Attorney General Eric Schneiderman. Schneiderman accepts their money, goes to meet with President Obama in Syracuse when Obama was in Syracuse. And in the next day or two files a lawsuit against me because they -- in my opinion, they gave him a contribution; then goes to see Obama.

You sort of see how the system works, folks. It's a bad system, let me tell you.

So Obama -- Obama meets with this dopey Eric Schneiderman, who hates our governor and he wants to run for governor, but I don't think it's going to happen. Go up to -- they go up to Syracuse, meets with Obama, and he files a lawsuit.

So, bottom line is this. People said, "You can settle." In fact, a lot of people said, "Oh, before you run, you should settle." I said, "I don't care; the people understand it." And they use it.

So when I have 10,000 people, and when we have mostly unbelievable reviews, how do you settle? And in fact when the case started originally, I said, "How can I settle when I have a review like this? Every review is good." Now, I should have settled, but I'm glad I didn't.

So I'll be seeing you in November either as president -- and I will say this. I have all these great reviews. But I will say this. I think Judge Curio (PH) should be ashamed of himself. I think it's a disgrace that he's doing this. And I look forward to going before a jury, not this judge, a jury and we will win that trial. We will win that trial. Check it out. Check it out, folks.

And you know, I tell this to people -- November 28th, I think it's scheduled for; shouldn't be a trial; should be a summary judgment dismissal.

By the way, friends of mine that are great lawyers, in fact one of them represents you, said, "How the hell do you get sued under RICO for a guy that took a course, loved the course, said great things about the course, and then you get sued under RICO?"

It is a disgrace. Now, I'm talking about Bernie Sanders has a rigged system. It is rigged. I'm talking about I had a rigged system, except we won by so much. I will tell you, this court system -- the judges in this court system, federal court. They ought to look into that Judge Curiel because what Judge Curiel is doing is a total disgrace. OK?

But we'll come back in November. Wouldn't that be wild if I'm president and I come back to do a civil case?

Where -- everybody likes it. OK. This is called life, folks. So here's what we're going to do. We are going to run this country properly with heart, with passion. We are going to save Social Security. We are going to save -- without cuts, we're going to save Social Security. We're going to bring back and save our Medicare, which people want to cut like hell. We're going to knock out -- remember this, knock out Common Core. Our educational system is a mess.

(APPLAUSE)

We're going to knock out Common Core. We're going to bring our education to a local level and we're going to do great. Repeal and replace Obamacare. We are going to save our Second Amendment. Remember. Remember.

(APPLAUSE)

Crooked Hillary wants to terminate -- she wants to abolish our Second Amendment. The NRA -- the NRA last week gave me their full endorsement. The first time in the history of the NRA, the earliest endorsement they've ever given. And I'm honored. And by the way, they're great people. They are incredible people. They're great people.

We're going to start very soon -- as soon as we get in there, we're going to renegotiate our trade deals that are killing our country, OK? We're going to renegotiate with China. We're going to -- and we're going to have better relationships than we have right now. We are going to renegotiate our deals. We are going to renegotiate everything. Everything is up for grabs.

Wait until you see the incredible potential that this country has when we're not run by people with no common sense, with no business ability, frankly, with no heart -- they have zero heart -- and people that are incompetent. Wait until you see what we're able to do in a fairly quick period of time.

So I went out. As you know, we won New York big. We won everything, but we won New York big. Originally, and I owe it to them because drugs are pouring across the border and New Hampshire was my first victory. So I love New Hampshire. And you look at the streams and the beautiful trees and the rivers. New Hampshire people, obviously. I love you, too. Thank you.

But it was my first victory. We won New Hampshire. That was supposed to be Bush, and he spent many more times than me. Wouldn't it be nice to hear, as the president, I've spent less money on this campaign than anybody else by far and have had the best results by far? Isn't that nice?

(APPLAUSE)

But isn't that what you want for your president, OK? Are we tired of this horrible stuff that we witness? Every single thing we do, over budget, way behind schedule. We're going to change it. You know, I'm building a hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue between the White House and the Capitol building. The old post office. It's one and half years -- really, it's more than that. I even hate to say it because nobody believes -- it's actually two years, but I like to say one year.

But we're opening in September a hotel at least 1.5 years ahead of schedule, under budget, and yet it's a higher-quality hotel than anybody ever saw before. I think it will end up being one of the great hotels of the world. And we're ahead of schedule, under budget, and yet, we have increased the scope of the hotel and it's going to be something our country is proud of.

I made the deal with the GSA, government services. One of the most competitive deals in the history of government services. They made it for two reasons. Number one, they wanted to make sure it gets done and they looked at my balance sheet and they almost feel off their chairs. They said it's going to get done. Number two -- that was important because they don't want a half-built hotel. The other thing, they wanted a great concept. Wait until you see this.

Now, I love opening it on September 15. Maybe I should wait until around November 2nd or 3rd, because that's going to be a great opening. And the problem with you guys is you tend to forget we have like a two-week-span, we have a two-week memory span. You know what I'm going to do? I think I'll open it up a little bit later. I'll still be so far. But it's going to be fantastic. That's what we should be doing for our country.

You see our roads coming in so far above budget. You see our bridges. We don't build bridges, for the most part. You know, in the old days, we used to build bridges.

You go to China -- bridges all over the place. It makes our bridges look like toys. Beautiful airports. You go to the Middle Eastern countries, many of them. They have airports the likes of which you've never seen, the most incredible structures, the most incredible buildings. And then we fly home and we land at LaGuardia with the potholes all over the runway. It's true.

Or Kennedy or Newark or LAX. And it's a disgrace.

We have become a third world country, folks, and it's not going to happen any longer. It's not going to happen any longer.

(APPLAUSE)

So, what happened in Indiana was amazing. So we win all these states -- New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Delaware, Connecticut, Maryland. And by the way, won every county in every state. It's never happened before. Won by landslide, where even the slime -- the slime sitting over there, they would say -- they used to say, they can't say it anymore, because now we're getting 78 percent.

But they used to say, "Donald Trump has not cracked 50 percent; yes, he's won, but he hasn't cracked 50 percent." I say there's 12 people running. There's 12. More importantly, and boy are we cracking 50 percent now, more importantly, in the history of the Republican Party, we've received more votes than anybody by far, by millions.

(APPLAUSE)

And we have 10 states left to go; 10 states.

And they'll never say that. They don't say that. So, you know, I might as well tell you. You know the expression, "If you don't toot your own horn, you better do it, because nobody else is going to do it for you." This slime is never going to do it, that I can tell you.

I just read a story by a woman named Parker and a woman named Haberman (PH) that's in the New York Times. And instead of saying, "Donald Trump won the Republican primary " -- give me a break, give me one day, right? They say, "His style of negotiation and the way he runs and the fact that he did this " -- all nonsense -- and they say, "The Republican Party " -- well, in all fairness to everybody, even them, the Republican Party is really coming together quickly.

You just saw Darrell Issa. You just saw Duncan. All these people. These are the best. It's really coming together quickly. And we're up to over 90 percent in terms of approval rate. And last time we had this clown named Mitt Romney who let us all down. I backed him. I backed him. And worked for him.

So John McCain -- that was a tough race. John McCain lost. Mitt Romney lost. I said, "This time we're going to do it ourselves, folks, we're going to win; we're going to win."

(APPLAUSE)

But -- and we are going to win. But just don't even think about it. And before we forget, so we've won the nomination, big, by numbers that you can't believe. But you've got to go out and vote in two weeks anyway because we want the mandate. We want the mandate. We have to have the mandate.

So these two reporters -- I just read their story -- wise guys. They're not talented people. And they're saying, "Donald Trump is having a hard time bringing the Republican Party together." Why don't they say I won the nomination finally?

It's as negative as you can make something sound that's a total positive. It's a little like I give the vets almost $6 million and they try and -- I didn't have to give them anything. You know, it's funny. I make a speech. And during the speech, I say, "Hey, let's raise some money for the vets." And I figured maybe we'd get a million bucks.

And I told you before, then maybe $2 million. I end up -- and we're giving a full list on Tuesday -- but I've got these guys and they knock it. And we raise this. So I take something where nobody even thinks about it. You raise this fantastic amount of money. I'm giving it, I guess, to over 30 organizations, all great organizations. And instead of getting praise, they sort of knock you.

And I say, "How do you get bad publicity when you've raised over $6 million?" Same thing here. So these two reporters, and they always pretend like they're your friend. "Oh, gee, Mr. Trump." The New York Times, I call it the "failing" New York Times is a disgrace. And by the way, the Washington Post is not much better. They are -- they've got 22 people on me right now.

I'll tell you why (PH). And I've always heard if you're a very successful person, you cannot run for office, but you especially can't run for president.

So The Washington Post has 22 people on me now, 22 reporters. Now, that's being run (PH) because the person that owns The Washington Post also has a big thing in Amazon, which is a much more important thing. So he uses The Washington Post for power and he thinks that he's going to get the politicians to do what he wants, and he probably will. But me, I couldn't care less.

(APPLAUSE)

And he doesn't want to pay -- just listen. He doesn't want to pay tax on the internet. That's it. And he'll use that so that they're not going to tax Amazon on the internet. In the meantime, your department stores are all going out of business because it's unfair competition. So now, he's got a threat in terms of monopoly.

Now, he knows I'm the only one that says it. The politicians are afraid to say it because he owns The Washington Post. So the other day, I get a call. They've got 22 guys, they're slopping all the stuff together and they're going to do a book that comes out in August. Wait until you see that one.

So these -- are you OK? Yes. You make sure he's OK. Make sure he's perfect. Are you OK? You make sure, OK? We love these people. They've been standing here for six hours.

(APPLAUSE)

And that's my great World War II vet and the people that are looking at him, they don't realize he's tougher than all of us in this room, folks (INAUDIBLE).

(APPLAUSE)

So I love to call these institutions out. Now, no politician is going to do that because they care too much. Well, I care too, but I care about doing the right thing. And so it's just very interesting.

Here's one other thing I have to tell you. The New York times last week made a fool out of themselves. They did a story on the front page of the Sunday Times. The top of the fold, most important -- center -- a massive picture of me standing with beauty pageant contestants, right?

And then they interviewed 50 or 60 people. They put a few of them in because most of them said good things, and the few of them revolted because they said, "That's not what we said. That's now what we implied. We like Donald Trump. We love Donald trump. Donald trump treated us with respect." One of them, Rowanne Brewer, got married. Rowanne Brewer-Lane. And I said, boy isn't that terrible, that story?

They wrote it very disrespectfully. Not very serious charges, in all fairness. But they wrote it really very disrespectfully. And I saw her on television and then I saw her again on television. And she was saying it was incorrect what they said. What they said was meant maliciously, and I like Donald Trump and respected Donald Trump and he always treated me great and you should not write like that. And then I had Carrie Prejean, a very fantastic young woman who was a member, and a very successful one, of the beauty pageants.

And I see Carrie is here right now. Carrie. We love Carrie. And she married a great athlete and they're standing there together and he's great. they have a great -- and Carrie's so always going on and they mischaracterized her and they said they spoke to her and they never even spoke to her and they wrote false stuff.

And then they wrote about another one and that was false. And then they wrote about a construction woman that worked for me named Barbara Res. I gave her the break of a lifetime. I let her build a major building in New York City where she was the construction manager, probably never happened to a woman before. I gave a woman a break.

My father said "Donald, don't do that." I said, "Why?" He's a little from the old school, you know? I said, "Pop, it's going to be good." He said, "I'm telling you, you're making a mistake, don't do it." I said, "Pops, you'll (PH) do fine. Don't worry about it." He said, "All right. Whatever you want to do."

So I let her do it and gave her the break of her lifetime. Then when she left, she wanted to come back because you know, the grass is always greener. She left. Now all of a sudden, she loves Trump. And for a long time, she has wanted to come back, for many, many years. And she writes -- thank goodness for emails. I love emails. They never go away. Hillary, do you hear that?

(LAUGHTER)

They never go away, Hillary.

(APPLAUSE)

You know, Hillary is missing -- Hillary is missing 30,000 e- mails. I have people that will retrieve those emails.

(APPLAUSE)

I don't think -- I don't think they want to find those emails because frankly, what Hillary has done is criminal, folks, it's criminal and those emails do not hide. Let's get back to the New York Times. So Barbara Res. So I gave her the break of a lifetime. She writes a book. The book is glowing about Donald Trump and she said some strange things. She said in the book -- this never came up -- she said in the book, "Donald Trump is not sexist." Who would say that? I mean, just out of (INAUDIBLE). You don't write that, unless you have evil thoughts, right?

You don't write that. Is that correct? Carrie (PH), is that correct?

So she puts in the book something to the effect that Donald Trump is not sexist. I said that's a strange statement, although I must say I never read the book, but I read some passages. But it was a good book about me.

But she wants to come back. So she's emailing to my secretaries for years, "Oh, I want to come back; Donald Trump is the greatest; I've never met anybody like him; he's not a sexist person; he's the greatest, greatest, greatest, " letter after letter, email after e- mail. And then she's in the New York Times and she's saying, "Oh, he's a horrible person, horrible."

And he said to me, and by the way, just so you understand, one of my men said I read about Barbara Rust (PH). She had the most foul mouth of any human being I've ever seen. She used to walk into a group of men and start using the "F" word all over. And I had to bring her into my office to calm her down. She was going crazy.

All right. So are you ready? So now she writes all these letters that Trump is the greatest. And now I see her picture, and I say, "Oh, that's good, I'll get a good -- at least somebody will say good, " because I didn't know that Carrie Brejean was going to come out and say "great " after reading negative stuff.

I didn't know that Rowan Brewer (PH) was going to come out and say, "great " after reading negative stuff. It was unbelievable. But then I saw this, and I said, "Great." I gave her a job that no other woman would be given; nobody -- there was nobody even close. I was 25 years ahead of my time with women. OK?

And to this day, I have women that are making more money for the same job as my men, and I'm happy about it, and I expect a lawsuit any day from the men. They'll sue me that they're not making it because we're living in that kind of a society.

My men will be suing me on Monday morning because they're not making as much as the women. I don't care. I don't care. Because we're doing great with women. I don't believe the polls. I can tell -- look at all the women. We're doing great with women. Women for Trump. Women for Trump.

(APPLAUSE)

Thank you. Wow. Thank you very much.

I think we're doing great. And by the way, the numbers with women are going up. But you know what women want to see? They want to see strong borders. They want to see a strong military. They want to see strength. Is that right? They want to see strength.

(APPLAUSE)

And I'll tell you what, they want to see jobs. They want an economy that's going to boom. And nobody -- everybody admits -- I think even Hillary admits, but everybody admits that what I'll do for the economy, nobody else can do.

So here's the end result. So the New York Times calls and they want to meet. So they met. And they (INAUDIBLE), because they are so embarrassed. Who's with the New York Times? I hope it's not Maggie Haberman PH or Parker, because they're not legit. Where's the New York Times reporter?

I call it "the failing New York Times." So the New York Times wants to meet, so they met with one of my guys. They had a good meeting; didn't mean anything. You know, they just -- I think they just don't want to be sued, you want to know the truth. But these people are very dishonest.

The New York Times, the Washington Post, most of the people up there. Now, some of them are fine -- not too many of them, but some of them are fine. But you have to fight back. When somebody hits you, you have to fight back.

Now, with the Times piece, and you know what I said to this Barbara Rust? I said -- here was my -- I had friends that called me. They said, "Man, you're not very cool." I said to Barbara Rust (PH), "Maybe you shouldn't be eating that piece of candy." That's a little bit different than Bill Clinton, I think. OK?

(LAUGHTER)

A little bit. Maybe. And she said -- now here's a woman that used the F-bomb more than any person I've ever heard. And she said, "He was obviously talking about my weight." I mean, give me a break folks. We are -- we are so politically correct now, our country is dying from within. We've got to get back to business. We've got to rebuild our country. We've got to rebuild our infrastructure.

Remember this, almost $5 trillion spent in the Middle East, and we don't have enough room to fix a road that's right outside that, by the way, I looked at just now. It's in horrible shape. OK? We can't fix our highways, our tunnels. And we're going to get it going, folks.

We're going to get it going. You are going to be so proud of your country once again.

So here's the story. I came here and I'm leading in the polls, we're leading in almost every poll now. Do you believe this? It's so great. But I came here and I said, and specifically, we were in Costa Mesa. We had a tremendous rally. Who was there? Were you there? Thirty-one thousand people. Nobody even showed it because there were a couple of thugs outside burning the American flag, holding other flags up in the air. They were burning and they were stomping on a car -- a police car -- stomping on it.

By the way, did you see when he got off that car? He broke his ass. Did you see that?

(APPLAUSE)

He tried to pretend he wasn't hurt. That was adrenaline. Oh, did he hurt. Oh, was he hurt. He -- that guy walked away, he said that was painful.

But all you saw was this thug and these people burning the American flag and holding up flags from other countries. These are thugs. They hardly showed the rally that we had inside where we had the parents of young children who were killed by illegal immigrants, right? Where we had the most amazing lovefest, like this. The most -- even more people. Where we had the most amazing lovefest.

You know, a friend of mine came to me and he came to Dallas. We had 21,000 people at the Mavericks arena. He said to me, "Donald, can I ask you a question? How do you do this? You're here to speak in front of these people." A very good musician said Trump is the greatest in the world without a guitar, meaning without an instrument. I've got to stand up here by myself. If I bomb -- if I bomb, they will -- believe me, they'll let us know about it.

But he said to me, "How do you do this?" And I looked at this -- this is, by the way, one of the most successful people in the country, in the world. And he looked at this massive audience like this today and like I had a little while ago in Fresno. And he looked at this massive audience, he said, "How can you get up there and speak? Do you have notes?" I say, "No." "Do you have something?" I say, "No, I have like a good head."

(APPLAUSE)

I have a good memory. I have a very good memory. But he said, "How do you do it?" And I said, "You know, honestly, it's not hard because there's so much love in the room." It's unbelievable. There's love in the room. We want to take our country back. We want to take our country back. We're tired of being the stupid people all over the world. We are tired of it, and we're going to end it.

(APPLAUSE)

Thank you. So folks, I love ending this way. And you know, we're on live television so much and it's embarrassing because we get these crazy ratings, so they take advantage of all of us and they put me on all the time. Look at all the cameras.

You know, when Hillary comes, you have no cameras. Nobody wants to watch. And it's always difficult because you have to make different speeches. You can't be on live television all the time, right, and make the same speech because people are going to say he said that this morning, he said that yesterday. So you're going to make -- which is a little tougher.

But the nice part is I can talk about current events. I can talk about things like we mentioned before, the TSA, how badly it's being managed. I can talk about our vets, how badly just things over the last two days came down. You say what's going on. It's out of control. Our Veterans Administration is a corrupt enterprise. You ought to get Judge Curiel to look into that instead of wasting everybody's time so that he can take advantage of Donald Trump. That's what Judge Curiel do. He should be ashamed of himself.

But here's the story, folks. I like to end it this way. And how many ways can you end something? And you know, somebody said make America great again is a very negative statement. I said no, no, no. It's a very positive statement because we are going to make America great again. But listen. Listen. We don't win anymore as a country. We don't win with our military, with education, with trade, with anything. We don't win.

And now, they want to take your Second Amendment away? That's not going to happen. But we don't win anymore. And I say this and I have fun saying it and I love saying it and we can't do it any better. We are going to start winning again big-league.

(APPLAUSE)

We're going to win with our military. We're going to knock the hell out of ISIS.

(APPLAUSE)

We're going to win for our great vets, and they are great.

(APPLAUSE)

We're going to win for our great vets. They have not been treated properly. Illegal immigrants get better treatment in many cases than our veterans, and that's not going to happen. It's not going to happen. So we're going to win for our vets. We're going to win on education. No more Common Core; bring it down. Bring it down. We want it local.

(APPLAUSE)

We're going to win with healthcare. We're going to win at the border. We're going to win at trade. We're going to win so much that you people are going to be calling your president and you're going to say, "Please, Mr. President, we don't want to win anymore. You're winning too much. You're driving us crazy." And I'm going to say...

(APPLAUSE)

And I'm going to say, "I am very sorry, but we're going to keep winning and we're going to win, win, win and we're going to make America great again." I love you. Thank you. I love you, San Diego. Get out and vote. Get out and vote. We're going to win California. Get out and vote. Thank you, everybody.

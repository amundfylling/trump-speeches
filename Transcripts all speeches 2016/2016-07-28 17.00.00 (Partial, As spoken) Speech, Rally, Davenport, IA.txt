DONALD TRUMP: I've been watching these speeches at night. And boy, am I getting hit! Oh! Oh! Oh!

(LAUGHTER)

I am getting hit, and they don't mean it, and there's a lot of lies being told, but I guess they have to do their thing.

They are not talking about radical Islamic terrorism. They're not talking about borders where people just pour across. They're not talking about the crime, the kind of crime that we have in this nation.

They're not talking about the fact that many people in our country are making less money today in terms of real wages than they were making 18 years ago. They're not talking about that. They're not talking about ISIS and what ISIS is doing and our depleted military, where our military isn't being properly funded and it's being depleted, and where people leave the military at the top level. They don't talk about that. They're not talking about it.

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

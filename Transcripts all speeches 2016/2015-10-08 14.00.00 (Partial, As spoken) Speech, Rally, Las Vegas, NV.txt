DONALD TRUMP: Thank you very much. Thank you. So nice. Thank you.

(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

Thank you very much.

What a great group. They have hundreds and hundreds of people standing outside. They can't get in. They didn't get the good real estate. You got the good real estate. I feel badly. I feel badly.

(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

So, Phil Ruffin, Phil owns this hotel. And he's been a friend of mine and we did deals together. We had a great success at Trump International Hotel together. I hope you all know that hotel, the most beautiful building in Las Vegas, I have to say.

But it's a great thing to be involved with somebody that is so talented, so smart, such a great business person. There's Phil Ruffin, believe me. And he's a great poker player.

I always put my money on him in a game in poker and he just walks away very quietly, just takes everybody's money and goes on to the next one. Right? That's what we want.

I want to just thank you. I love you too. I love you.

I want to just start by saying Kevin McCarthy is out. You know that, right?

(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

And they are giving me a lot of credit because I said you really need somebody very, very tough and very smart. Smart goes with tough, not just tough. I know tough people. They are not smart. That's the worst. OK? That's the worst. You have got to be smart.

But we need smart, we need tough, we need the whole package. And it's a positive. Yes, like me. Thank you. I like that. I like this guy over here, whoever he is.

But It's bedlam in Washington right now, bedlam. It's a mess. I have never seen anything like it. I have doing this for a long time. I have always been in politics. People said, well, he's -- for three months, I have been a politician, though. Can you believe it? It's so embarrassing, I'm a politician.

I never wanted to be a politician. But at some point, I said we're going to make our country great again. We're going to do it.

GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Mr. Trump, thank you for doing this.

DONALD TRUMP: Thank you.

GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: So 13 days to go. How do you pull this out?

DONALD TRUMP: Well, I think we're doing very well. The new polls just came out. We're leading in Florida. If you look at the lines and -- all of the people standing on lines in the state of Florida, it's incredible. I just had last night, as you know, I was in Tallahassee. We had 25,000 people. We had 16,000 people the night before. We're -- we're have, I mean, if I have a crowd less than 15,000 people it's considered a small crowd. There's never been anything like that. Now after this I'm going to North Carolina where we're also doing very well. The polls are indicating that we're leading in Florida, we're leading in North Carolina, we're leading in Ohio.

GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Well, there -- there's a new Bloomberg poll out in Florida that shows you had that as absolutely true. But almost every poll -- public poll in Florida and North Carolina taken since the first debate shows her ahead.

DONALD TRUMP: Yeah, but all of the most recent ones, and if you look at the enthusiasm on the lines, what they're now talking about are the lines. Because you have early voting in Florida. And the enthusiasm on the lines is unbelievable.

GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: So you're not fighting from behind?

DONALD TRUMP: George, I think I'm gonna win. I mean, what can I tell you? I think I'm gonna win. I -- I really believe that we've gotten a very unfair narrative from the press. I feel the press is very dishonest. I don't feel. I know the press is very dishonest. And I think we're going to win. I think we're gonna win Florida. I think we're gonna win Ohio. You know, it used to be if you win Florida, you win Ohio, you win. We're gonna win North Carolina, we're gonna win a lot of states.

GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: You're gonna win all three of those?

DONALD TRUMP: Yeah, I -- I think I will. I think I will.

GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: And what do you say --

DONALD TRUMP: And I think we'll win a lot more than that. We just got great numbers on Wisconsin, as an example. I think we're gonna win a lot more than that.

GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: I did the first interview of this campaign on the first day, Trump Tower.

DONALD TRUMP: You did.

GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: And we're --

DONALD TRUMP: That's right.

GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: -- here in a Trump Hotel --

DONALD TRUMP: That's right.

GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: -- today. But what do you say to supporters of yours who think you shouldn't be taking time off the campaign trail from the battleground states to --

DONALD TRUMP: Well, I think it's so unfair because, you know, Hillary Clinton goes to see an Adele concert last night and everybody says, "Oh wasn't that nice? Isn't that wonderful." I have stopped -- I did eight stops yesterday. Three major rallies where, you know, I told you 25 and 15 and 20 it -- it's -- thousands of people.

I did three plus many other stops. I came here. And let me just tell you what this is about, under budget, ahead of schedule. I built one of the great hotels of the world. What am I supposed to do, not show up? I'm taking one hour off. I'm going to North Carolina right after this. Then I'm going back down to Florida. I'm going up to New Hampshire.

I'm all over the place. But I can't take one hour off to cut a ribbon at -- one of the great hotels of the world? I mean, I think I'm entitled to it. She goes, she does one stop because she has no energy. She's going nothin' going. She does one stop. And nobody complains about that. Nobody complains when she goes to an Adele concert all night long while I'm making two speeches at rallies with, you know, massive crowds.

I come here and it's true. There's a narrative. You have it and a couple of the other haters have it, "Donald Trump is stopping," I mean, I spent $200 million building a hotel. But you know why I really wanted this? And I love the fact that it just opened just before because I built this hotel under budget and ahead of schedule. Now that's why I'm doing this. That's one of the -- I think I'd be here in any event.

GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: It sends a message, front page of the Wall --

DONALD TRUMP: No, it sends -- you know what it does, it sends a real message, George, because we have road projects and tunnels and all the things we're doing. And they're costing three, four times what they were supposed to cost and they never get finished.

GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Front page of the Washington Post today says you're not gonna have any more fundraisers this campaign. She is definitely gonna outspend you in the home stretch. To avoid that, are you willing to write a check to your campaign?

DONALD TRUMP: Yeah, I am. I mean, look, I'm gonna be in for over $100 million.

GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Only $56 million so far.

DONALD TRUMP: Well, no, it's 61. But I'm spending a lot of money. And that doesn't include everything. I'm spending a lot of money. And, look, she's spending nothing. She ripped off the country for $250 million. She spends -- she has no money invested in her campaign. Zero. Fact, I asked her at one of the debates, I said, "Why aren't you putting up ten or 20 or 15 or something million dollars?" And she didn't respond.

GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: How much more are you gonna put up between now and election day?

DONALD TRUMP: I would say a lot. I'm not gonna say what. But I will be over $100 million and it could be much more than that.

GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: You've talked a lot about the fact that you think this election could be rigged. I wanna go back to 2012. You sent out a tweet --

DONALD TRUMP: I think the system is rigged.

GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: -- election night --

DONALD TRUMP: I think the system is rigged.

GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: -- 2012. "This election is a total sham and a travesty. We are not a democracy." How was the 2012 election rigged?

DONALD TRUMP: Because I look at the way the media treats the Republicans and conservatives. And I see the way it's so skewed. If things are good, like this morning, I watched one of the networks -- they were devastated when the Bloomberg poll came out that said I was leading.

They were devastated when they went down and they interviewed the people on the lines waiting to vote yesterday and they were, like, devastated 'cause they couldn't find anybody -- in Florida they couldn't find anybody wanting to vote for -- for Hillary. Look -- it's so skewed. The media is part of the problem.

GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: But you called the --

DONALD TRUMP: It's so --

GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: -- whole election a sham and a travesty.

DONALD TRUMP: -- oh, well, I think it was -- horrible the way they were treated in the media. The only thing worse is the way I'm being treated. Look, I'm being treated -- hey, it's record-setting bad treatment what I'm getting. It's the greatest pile-on in American history. I think beyond politics.

It's the greatest pile-on. And that's OK. I'm OK with it. Because you know what, the people get it. The people understand what's going on, George. They really get it. I go to these rallies and they're starting to hate the media because they see it's all a big lie. Not all. But a lot of it's a big lie. Now at the same time --

GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: -- of, like, $1 billion in free media during the primaries.

DONALD TRUMP: Oh I don't know if you'd call it $1 billion in free when it's bad. I mean, they give me -- I do things that are good. For instance, I open up a hotel. I employed thousands of people building it and operating -- and they're all saying, "Why is he off the trail?"

Now everybody's been saying that I have more energy than anybody they've ever seen. And you might have to say that. Nobody's ever done so many -- I start at 7:00 in the morning. I get home at 1:00 in the morning. And then I get up and do another speech at 8:00.

And in the meantime, she's sleeping all day long. Look, she does one or two events. I do eight. Then I come to Washington D.C. I cut a ribbon. And on the thing it's, "Why is Donald off the trail?" I mean, I've done so much more than her and I can't time out. But I'm off it because of under budget, ahead of schedule.

GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: If --

DONALD TRUMP: Now -- now I will say this, that's a very unfair statement. What should really be -- they should be talking about WikiLeaks and the horrible things that have come out about Hillary Clinton. The horrible things. They should talk about the FBI getting paid six -- I mean, the -- the head investigator getting paid $675,000, the wife, for a campaign contribution. Essentially from her best friend. You know that better than anybody. And she's under investigation and this is the man that's the head of the investigation? And the wife is getting paid $675,000?

GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Contributions to her campaign all before --

DONALD TRUMP: Oh that's a --

GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: -- he took it over.

DONALD TRUMP: -- terrible thing. That's a terrible thing. Nobody's ever seen anything --

GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Let -- let's --

DONALD TRUMP: -- like that.

GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: -- take on this election idea.

DONALD TRUMP: And George, she's so guilty she -- she deleted 33,000 emails. They're missing boxes of emails. She's so guilty. How can she even run? You have to see, there's such anger in this country. And the anger is about that. But there is such anger in this country over what she got away with.

GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: The FBI director, appointed by Republicand has said, "No reasonable prosecutor would bring this case."

DONALD TRUMP: Well, he's -- he made a mistake. OK? Or -- or whatever. I -- I won't -- I don't even call it a mistake. I think something happened. Look, something happened. You --

GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: What happened?

DONALD TRUMP: -- Well, I think somebody talked to him. I think -- hey, look, how can President Clinton when --

GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: So you're saying --

DONALD TRUMP: -- the attorney general --

GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: -- the head of the FBI is corrupt?

DONALD TRUMP: -- says something going on -- George, George, she's so guilty. Congress sends a subpoena, she deletes all of her emails. OK? She deletes 'em. Now there are other things also. Many other things. But just take that one. Don't even talk about anything else. There are many, many other things.

Missing boxes of emails. Deleting emails after they send her -- now, who's more important in terms of getting a subpoena than the United States Congress? She deletes 33,000 emails and gets away with it? And yet General Cartwright could go to jail --

GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: You --

DONALD TRUMP: -- fo -- George, General Cartwright, four-star general, could go to jail, think of this, for five years --

GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: -- you've made the point that you think --

DONALD TRUMP: -- and Petraeus' life has been destroyed --

GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: -- you've made the --

DONALD TRUMP: -- great general.

GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: -- point that you think she's guilty. But if she does -- I know you think --

DONALD TRUMP: I -- no, no, I don't think she's guilty. I know she's guilty.

GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: -- if -- if she wins -- I know you think you're gonna win. But if she wins -- if she gets the kind of win that President Obama got, more than 300 electoral votes, several million in the popular vote, will you accept that --

DONALD TRUMP: George, I've said --

GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: -- as a clear result?

DONALD TRUMP: -- it many times. I'll make that decision at the right time. I mean, don't worry about it. I'll make the decision at the right time. But we have a rigged system. And I'll tell you how the system's rigged. It's rigged by the media because it's totally unfair and biased. It's rigged by the media.

And it's rigged when you see somebody running for office who shouldn't be allowed to run for office. Hillary Clinton deleted 33,000 emails. Do you know what was on those emails? And she said they were for the wedding and her spa, OK, yoga classes, 33,000 emails.

I would tell you what was on those emails was horrendous. Look at what's coming out with WikiLeaks. Look at what they're saying, what Podesta says that Hillary Clinton running for president has bad instincts. First of all, he should be fired if for no other reason he's very disrespectful to her. He says a lot of bad things about her. But he said she's got bad instincts. Bernie Sanders says she's got bad judgment. So if Podesta says bad instincts, Sanders says bad judgment why are people even thinking --

GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: All 17 --

DONALD TRUMP: -- about voting for --

GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: -- U.S. intelligence agencies believe the Russians are behind that leak. Why don't you believe it?

DONALD TRUMP: I don't know if they're behind it. And I think it's -- public relations, frankly. Do you know what does bother me? I have nothing to do with those --

GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: But you were even told by the --

DONALD TRUMP: -- George, George, let me explain some --

GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: -- Republican head of the homeland security --

DONALD TRUMP: -- let me explain something.

GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: -- Mike McCaul, he said the same thing.

DONALD TRUMP: I don't know what he said.

GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: He told you that he thought the Russians were behind it.

DONALD TRUMP: Hacking is very interesting. Hacking is very hard to determine who did what. OK? You know that. People are hacking all over the place and nobody knows. They don't know if it's Russia. They can't guarantee it's Russia. And it may be. I mean, it may be Russia. I have nothing to do with Russia. She likes to put the narrative about Donald Trump with Russia. I have nothing to do with Russia. I don't owe money. I don't have deals in Russia. I don't know Putin.

GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: But why not accept our intelligence agency's conclusion?

DONALD TRUMP: Well, I haven't seen the conclusion. But you know what, hacking I understand. And you really -- it's very hard to determine who's doing the hacking. What I have seen though is I have seen WikiLeaks. And where they came from, I don't know.

But they're real. And they're not even being denied. And the disrespect that those people have, and the dishonesty too, by the way, the dishonesty, I mean, the one that came out yesterday about, you know, the server and going to President Obama, so therefore he knew about it, that brings him into the picture which he didn't wanna be brought into that picture. But her emails going to him and he understands. And these are supposed to be --

GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: So you want --

DONALD TRUMP: -- classified emails --

GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: -- you want a special --

DONALD TRUMP: -- the whole thing, I'll tell you what, the whole thing is a scam. And it's horrible.

GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: -- you want a special prosecutor to investigate Hillary Clinton. So now President Obama should be investigated as well? That's what you said yesterday.

DONALD TRUMP: No but President Obama made the statement that he didn't know anything about it. But in the meantime he's getting emails. So it proved that he did know about it.

GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: You said yesterday he should be investigated -- you said --

DONALD TRUMP: Who should be investigated?

GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: -- by the -- the president.

DONALD TRUMP: Let them do whatever they want. Look, he knew. He lied. He certainly lied. Because he knew the emails because they were sent to him.

GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Let's talk about Mosul.

DONALD TRUMP: And that was a big deal yesterday. I mean, you do agree that was a big deal yesterday.

GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: It was new -- it was news yesterday. It was --

DONALD TRUMP: It was news. It was news.

GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Let's talk about Mosul. On -- on Sunday you sent out a tweet saying that the inva -- that the operation was a total disaster. The defense secretary's on the ground. He says they're making progress. He's encouraged by the pros -- progress. The former dean of the Army War College says, "This shows that Trump doesn't know a damn thing about military strategy."

DONALD TRUMP: The Army War College, let me tell you, the element of surprise. I've been hearing about Mosul now for three months. "We're going to attack. We're going to attack." Meaning Iraq's going to attack but with us. OK? We're going to attack.

Why do they have to talk about it? Why can't they keep it quiet and attack? Now as you know the attack is being met with great, you know, resistance because they were totally prepared because the politicians were all talking about it, because Obama's talking about it. Don't talk about it.

Element of surprise. General George Patton. You look at General George Patton. You look at -- you look at MacArthur. You look at these great generals. And I say it all the time, they're spinning in their grave. Mosul, number one, we shouldn't have even had to do it because when we got out -- we had Mosul. Now we have to take it a second time. We had Mosul. We have to take it because Hillary Clinton and Obama left that big vacuum and ISIS went in and they took Mosul.

GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: She said you're declaring --

DONALD TRUMP: But here's the other problem. Wait, wait --

GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: -- defeat before the battle is over.

DONALD TRUMP: -- let me -- let me finish with Mosul. Element of surprise. One of the reasons they wanted Mosul, they wanted to get ISIS leaders who they thought were, you know, in Mosul. Those people have all left. As soon as they heard they're gonna be attacked, they left. The resistance is --

GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: The defense secretary says 35 of them have been taken out.

DONALD TRUMP: -- excuse me, the resistance is much greater now because they knew about the attack. All I'm saying is this, we shouldn't have to be fighting for Mosul. We're only fighting for Mosul because Hillary Clinton blew it and gave it back to 'em. So now we have to take it a second time.

Of great importance, why do they have to talk? Why can't they win first and talk later? Why do they have to say three months before the attack, "We're going in." So you can tell your military expert that I'll sit down and I'll teach him a couple of things.

If he tells you that it's OK to announce, "Ladies and gentlemen, in three months we're going into Mosul," why would you say that? Why wouldn't you do a surprise attack, grab all these ISIS leaders? They all left, George. They all left because they happened to be smart. They heard it's gonna be attack. They left. And they left plenty of tough people behind because it's a tough attack. And you know that and it's being met with great resistance. I would've done it much differently. I woulda said very quietly to my generals, "Go get 'em and don't talk." They would've gone. They would've been -- it would've been much easier.

They would've probably gotten some people that they won't get now. And then I would've had a conference when it was all finished. And I would've told them what we did. Now your man on -- whoever this gentleman is -- I guarantee you -- I can put my narrative before the American people and let whoever this person is put his and they will agree with me.

GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: On Saturday you said that you'd threaten to sue the 11 women who've accused you of sexual assault.

DONALD TRUMP: You know, I hate that you waste time when we're talking about ISIS and we're talking about jobs and you're still bringing that up. Everybody wants to bring it up. Look --

GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: That was just Saturday.

DONALD TRUMP: -- these were false attacks. These things never happened. These people -- I don't know these people. These things never, ever happened. This was out of the blue. It was made up probably by the Clinton campaign.

GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Do you have any evidence of that?

DONALD TRUMP: Well, many of their stories have already been debunked. Many of the stories have already been debunked as you know.

GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: People Magazine story, they brought forward six witnesses to --

DONALD TRUMP: Why didn't she write the --

GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: -- corroborate the story.

DONALD TRUMP: -- story 12 years ago?

GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: She says she was afraid.

DONALD TRUMP: Oh she was afraid. Give me a break. She was afraid to write it, she would have gotten the Pulitzer Prize. Give me a break. She was afraid. And she had the butler as a witness, right, who no longer works for me. So she had the butler as a witness except for one problem --

GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Six corroborating wit --

DONALD TRUMP: -- excuse me. Excuse me. There was nobody corroborating. They said years later she talked about it. Look, the butler -- she said -- was there. One problem, the butler said it never happened. He doesn't work for me. No longer.

GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: He did.

DONALD TRUMP: He's a good man. By the way, he's a good man. But he hasn't worked for me in years. They went to the butler. He said it never happened. Nobody --

GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: So all of these women --

DONALD TRUMP: -- reported that.

GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: -- everyone they talked to are lying?

DONALD TRUMP: They made up stories. You know why? Fame or they wanted to help Clinton or something. They made up stories.

GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: They came out after you denied your --

DONALD TRUMP: George.

GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: -- behavior.

DONALD TRUMP: George, George, let's not waste any more time. These stories were fabricated. They're total lies.

GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: So you're gonna go through with the lawsuit.

DONALD TRUMP: We'll find out. Let's see what happens with the election. We're gonna find out. But I'm just telling you, these stories are total lies and you shouldn't be wasting time. And remember this, why didn't you write about the butler? You knew about the butler refuting her story. Why didn't anybody write it? It's a very unfair press.

GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: One of your toughest critics on this is the First Lady Michelle Obama. She says your behavior, your words are cruel. They are frightening. This is not how decent people behave. This is not how people who wanna be president behave.

DONALD TRUMP: Well, what's she gonna say? Is she gonna say I'm wonderful? Now, look, she made the statement about Hillary Clinton. I've heard this statement for years. I had no idea it was Michelle Obama. She made the statement that, "If you can't take care of your own house, you can't take of the White House." You know, I've heard that statement for years --

GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: She's talking about her own house.

DONALD TRUMP: Oh come on. Look, you know better than that. That was during the campaign. She said about Hillary Clinton, "You can't take care of your own house," meaning Bill Clinton, "Then how you can take care of the White House?" It was a vicious statement.

It was covered at the time. And it's gone all over the world. I mean, it's a very well-known statement. I would never have used it other than I saw the other night on television they went back eight years and they played that statement. It was her that made the statement.

GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: But what do you think about --

DONALD TRUMP: Now all of a sudden --

GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: -- what she's saying about you.

DONALD TRUMP: -- I'm such a bad person. Look, what is she going to say? Is she going to say I'm fantastic? Is she going to say I'm gonna not let jobs leave our country anymore. We're gonna keep our jobs? You have to see what's happening to our country. Our companies are leaving for Mexico and other places and we're losing our jobs.

Is she gonna say, "Trump is better at that than any other human being in the world," OK, which I believe I am. OK, I will stop it cold. We have so many things to do that, you know, but now, look, she's the first lady. She's gotta say what she's gotta say. I mean, I understand that. That's the game.

GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: President Obama says you should stop whining about the system.

DONALD TRUMP: I'm not whining about anything. I'm not whining about anything. Here's another one, so eight years ago Obama talked about the elections in Chicago. Essentially saying how they were rigged, oK. Now it's, "Oh, nobody would ever rig an election."

You have 1,800,000 dead people registered to vote. And some of 'em vote which is interesting. You have almost three million people that are registered to vote in two different states. Now I'm not making a big deal -- I think I'm gonna win the election. I think I'm gonna win. You look at Florida right now, you look at North Carolina, you look at Ohio, you look at Iowa, you look at these places, people are starting to get, I mean, the press is starting to get very concerned. And I see it all over the news this morning. But you look at what's going on in Florida where the lines are four blocks long and most of those people have red hats on -- I'll tell you what, things are gonna be --

GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: You do sound --

DONALD TRUMP: -- a little bit --

GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: -- pretty energized today. When you look back over the sweep of this campaign going back to -- to last June, is there anything you regret?

DONALD TRUMP: Oh absolutely. I'd love to have done certain things over. But you can't. You can't. But that's, George, life. I'd love to have -- have done in life certain things over, I guess. And you would have too.

GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Give me one.

DONALD TRUMP: You would have loved not to have contributed to the Clinton Foundation, as an example. There are things that you wish you didn't do, OK. You came very close to the edge. You would've loved to have had that decision over again. There are things I would've rather, you know, not happen.

But, George, all you can do is you put your head down and you have to go forward. But I'm really happy, look, I started off, you were one of -- actually Jonathan Karl, your person, did just about -- as a matter of fact, he was badly criticized, in this building. He did an interview.

I said, "I'm seriously thinking about running," and he was criticized 'cause everybody thought I was playing games. But when I ran it was 17 people -- it was actually 18. But it was 17 people, governors, senators, talented people, people like Ben Carson who's a phenomenal guy who endorsed me. But -- but there were 17, very talented, people, mostly politicians at the highest level. And everybody said, "You know what, Trump can't win this. These people have been doing this all their lives. He's got no experience."

And then one by one by one they disappeared. And one of your competitors said as they sat around a round table and talked about my entering the race -- one of your very smart competitors said -- they were all criticizing my going in -- said, "Be careful what you wish for," because he knew me. He knew me.

He said to the four women and two men sitting around a table on a certain network -- this one person said -- very smart guy, "Be careful what you wish for." And when I went into the campaign one by one they disappeared. Now some are, I mean, they signed pledges. Everybody signed a pledge. Some are, you know, they can't get over the loss. They got beaten very badly. They can't get over the loss. It's very dishonorable that they didn't endorse. It's very few. Three. But I am really happy with the way it's worked out.

GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Let me just bring one specific --

DONALD TRUMP: And I think most importantly I think we're g -- you know, this is a movement, like, that's never happened in this country. Even you will admit that. Even your friend, Bill O'Reilly said it's the most incredible thing he's ever seen in politics. OK. And it's -- a lot of it's because of the movement, because of the -- there is tremendous spirit out there for change.

GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Do you --

DONALD TRUMP: People want change.

GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: -- do you think you should've apologized to the Khans or Judge Curiel?

DONALD TRUMP: I have great respect for the Khan family. I have great respect for, I mean, the son is a great hero. But if I were president at that time, Captain Khan would be alive today, George. Because I wouldn't have been in Iraq. So if I were president Captain Khan's son would be --

GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: You did support it initially.

DONALD TRUMP: -- support --

GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: The invasion.

DONALD TRUMP: -- I never -- support -- look, look, let's get it straight. I was opposed to the war in Iraq. I was opposed to the war in Iraq. And for the most part the honest people agree with it. Right from --

GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: But the tape --

DONALD TRUMP: -- the beginning I was --

GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: -- Howard Stern's tape was pretty clear.

DONALD TRUMP: -- opposed now and that was way before the war started. And that was the first time I was ever even asked about Iraq and I gave a very, like -- I don't know. Who knows?

GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Right at the beginning.

DONALD TRUMP: That was long -- that was way before. If you look at just before the war started I said, "Don't do it. It's a mistake. You're gonna destabilize the Middle East." From the beginning, I was opposed to the war in Iraq. Then they did magazine articles right after the started, I was opposed to it then. And that was 100 percent.

Had I been president Captain Khan would be alive today. We wouldn't have been in this horrible, horrible mistake, the war in Iraq. We made a mistake in going in. And Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton made a terrible mistake in the way they took us out because we created a vacuum. They -- they got out so badly. It was so -- it was so -- I can only use the word stupid.

The way they got out of the war in Iraq was so bad. They left a vacuum. ISIS formed. ISIS now, George, is in 32 countries. Remember you said the JV, junior varsity. ISIS now is in 32 countries. And Hillary Clinton sh -- she says she's gonna stop 'em? Why didn't she do it before? Why didn't she do any of the things before? You know, she's been there, George, for 30 years. All of these things happened. Now she says she's gonna do this. Why didn't she do 'em before?

GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Final question. I heard backstage Cardinal Dolan said that you said Hillary Clinton was a tough and talented lady. S -- she said, "If I win we have to work together." I know you think you're gonna win. If she wins, are you prepared to work with her?

DONALD TRUMP: I just wanna make that decision at a later date. I'm not saying I'm not or I am. I just don't wanna tell you today. I wanna make that decision at the appropriate time. Hopefully I won't have to make that decision. I really believe we're gonna win.

We're gonna win Florida, we're gonna win Ohio, we're gonna win North Carolina, I think we're gonna Pennsylvania. You have to see what's going on in Pennsylvania. The crowds and the -- the people getting ready. I think we're gonna win Pennsylvania. I went to school there. I know it very well. I have amazing relationships. You look at the steel workers, the miners, they're all voting for Trump. I mean, she's against those industries. So I think we're gonna win Pennsylvania too. I think you will be very surprised.

GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: We'll see. Mr. Trump, thanks very much.

DONALD TRUMP: Thank you very much.

SEAN HANNITY: And welcome to "Hannity." And tonight, we are coming to you from Valdosta State University in beautiful Georgia, where 2016 Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump will be joining us in just a minute.

Now, we have a big audience and it's made up of Trump supporters, members of Georgia and the Georgia Republican groups, students from the university. Now, that's all ahead of tomorrow's super-Tuesday showdown. We have a brand-new CNN/ORC national poll. It shows Mr. Trump is now dominating the rest of the GOP field. He has 49 percent of the vote. Senator Marco Rubio's in second. He has 16 percent, Senator Ted Cruz in close third at 15 percent.

We have a lot to get to. So let's welcome to the stage the presidential front-runner for 2016 in the GOP, Donald Trump.

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

(CROSSTALK)

DONALD TRUMP: How are you?

SEAN HANNITY: All right, Mr. Trump. If you shake every hand...

DONALD TRUMP: Hi, everybody! Hi, everybody!

UNIDENTIFIED: Mr. Trump, can I take a selfie with you?

DONALD TRUMP: You got it.

UNIDENTIFIED: You're the best.

(CROSSTALK)

Welcome. Welcome.

DONALD TRUMP: Thank you. Wow, what a nice group. Come on.

(CROSSTALK)

SEAN HANNITY: You got the selfie, too?

DONALD TRUMP: How are you?

UNIDENTIFIED: Nice to see you, sir.

DONALD TRUMP: Hello, Sean.

SEAN HANNITY: Good to see you, Mr. Trump. Welcome Donald Trump.

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

DONALD TRUMP: Wow. Nice group.

SEAN HANNITY: Forty-nine percent!

DONALD TRUMP: That's big. That's a big number.

SEAN HANNITY: Did you watch...

DONALD TRUMP: That made me very happy. I just heard that for the first time (INAUDIBLE)

SEAN HANNITY: You know what's funny? I was watching some of the coverage of the other primaries, and I see these pundits. Some of them are so dumb. And they actually say, Well, if his person leaves or that person leaves, you take all of those numbers, every one of them, and give it to them, and Donald Trump may lose.

DONALD TRUMP: I've heard it many times, and in fact, from some of the folks on FOX, I must say.

SEAN HANNITY: Oh, boy.

DONALD TRUMP: That's all right. When it was 40, I know they said, Well, that means 60 percent of the people -- and I said, Well, you know, I'm going to get a lot of them as they leave. But they don't say that. No word -- 49 percent. That's pretty good, right?

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

With people still in the race. So we're very happy with that.

SEAN HANNITY: If you look at the polls, only state that you are really behind in tomorrow going in is Texas.

DONALD TRUMP: Yes, little bit.

SEAN HANNITY: So what does that mean?

DONALD TRUMP: I think we have a good chance in Texas. Look, you know, we're ahead in every state. You know, it was very interesting, if you look at South Carolina, we were supposed to lose that, and we won in a landslide. We were supposed to lose Nevada, and we won in a landslide. And New Hampshire was so great right from the beginning. And I don't know. I mean, I think we're going to do well, but we'll see what happens.

SEAN HANNITY: It was a pretty brutal weekend. I mean, if you believe some of your opponents -- let's see, you're a member of the mob and...

DONALD TRUMP: That was a new one.

SEAN HANNITY: What's that?

DONALD TRUMP: My sister said, Really?

(LAUGHTER)

SEAN HANNITY: She didn't know that? That you've hired illegal immigrants, you've cheated on your taxes. I mean, it seems like it's gotten very nasty at this point.

Yes, it is, nasty. Well, Rubio's a nasty guy. He's a nasty -- I always call him -- you know, I call him a lightweight. He's a nasty guy. And if you listen to him -- isn't he a nasty person?

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

You know, he said, He's 6-foot-2 or 6-foot-3 -- I'm 6-3, but you know, he said, He's 6-foot-2, and he said, But he's got small hands.

(LAUGHTER)

DONALD TRUMP: I said -- my hands aren't -- are they small?

(LAUGHTER)

I never heard of that one.

SEAN HANNITY: Yes.

DONALD TRUMP: But no, he's very nasty, and I think he's very desperate. And Cruz -- you know, look, I know he's a friend of yours, but he doesn't exactly -- he's not exactly truthful, and I think that's why I'm so well with evangelicals. They like the truth. He has a hard time telling the truth.

So the combination of -- and I used to think that Cruz was nasty, he was Untruthful and nasty. But he's more untruthful. The other one is nasty. Cruz is smarter of the two. He's the smarter of the two. And it'll be very interesting to see what happens.

SEAN HANNITY: But you know, there is a chance tomorrow night we will know after all the results are tallied that the only two people that will have won states, and you will have won the majority of them, are you and Ted Cruz.

DONALD TRUMP: Yes.

SEAN HANNITY: But what does that say about the other candidates, if they can't win a state...

DONALD TRUMP: It means it's tough for them.

UNIDENTIFIED: Bye-bye!

SEAN HANNITY: It means it's tough or impossible?

DONALD TRUMP: She got it right, just bye-bye. I think it's -- no, nothing...

(CROSSTALK)

Nothing's impossible.

UNIDENTIFIED: Bye-bye!

DONALD TRUMP: Bye-bye.

(LAUGHTER)

It means it's tough. But we'll see what happens.

SEAN HANNITY: I know this race at this at this point is always hard. With all -- as hard as you have been on some of the other others candidates, if you win this nomination and you're going up against Hillary Clinton, how tough -- you -- I'm sure these people want to know how tough would you be in a one-on-one matchup with her?

DONALD TRUMP: Well, first of all, I find it hard to believe she's going to be allowed to run. What she has done is so criminal that I just don't understand.

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

But you see Bernie is fading. I mean, he took a big, big beating in South Carolina. You know, it's interesting about South Carolina. So our party is getting bigger. And I'm just talking to the people in the party. They're so -- you know, they're very confused because they don't know me at all. You know, the top people, senators, and all these people, a lot of them don't know me. A lot of them do because, as you know, I've been in politics for a long time. But...

SEAN HANNITY: Seven months.

DONALD TRUMP: No, no, but I don't mean that. I mean behind the scenes (INAUDIBLE) I used to be establishment. You know, I'd write big checks all the time, right? I was establishment. When I did this, I was sort of very anti-establishment.

And a very big thing is I'm not taking money, so I'm not taking -- you know, I'm a self-funder. I'm doing my own funding...

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

... which means I don't need a lot of these people, which is a problem for them because I do my own, and I'm not -- like, I don't need the lobbyists. I don't need a big, big portion of people that make their living off politics.

I'm going to -- I'm working for you in the true sense. We're going to make great deals for our country...

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

You know, it's sort of interesting. So many companies and all, they have everybody under control. They have everybody taken care of one way or the other, through political contributions, and probably worse, but I would never say that, of course, but through political campaign contributions.

And the lobbyists and the special interests and all, they control everything. With me, there are no lobbyists. There are no special interests. I'm going to do what's right. If we have to -- right?

(APPLAUSE)

Sean, if we have to bid out -- if we have to bid out pharmaceuticals, we're bidding them out. We're going to save billions and billions and billions of dollars.

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

Right now, we have no bidding on drugs. You know, we're the largest drug purchaser in the world by far. We don't bid. We don't competitively bid. We would save billions. Now, the reason we don't bid, very simple, because the drug companies have all the senators and all the -- -- everybody's paid off.

SEAN HANNITY: I know a guy that runs a medical center and it's a practice that people join in Wichita, Kansas. They buy -- they literally buy drugs in mass directly from the pharmaceuticals at discounted rates, and they pay next to nothing.

DONALD TRUMP: And the government pays much more.

SEAN HANNITY: And the government pays 10 times more. Crazy, right?

DONALD TRUMP: It's very sad.

SEAN HANNITY: Let me talk about...

DONALD TRUMP: Honestly, it's very sad.

SEAN HANNITY: The establishment seems panicked. You all watching the establishment here? I just -- I just clipped these headlines. "Divisions within GOP over Trump's candidacy growing." "It's time for an anti-Trump Manhattan project." Karl Rove, "Time's running out to stop Trump." "Can Donald Trump be stopped?" " GOP leaders -- you must do everything in your power to stop Trump."

And then there's stories out there, Mr. Trump, and I'm sure you've heard them, where millionaires and billionaires are talking about pooling their money, and if Rubio doesn't win in super-Tuesday and in Florida, they'll throw another candidate at you, maybe Mitt Romney.

(LAUGHTER)

What is your...

DONALD TRUMP: They've tried that before. Hey, look...

SEAN HANNITY: But the...

DONALD TRUMP: ... Mitt Romney's a nice guy, but he tried and he failed and he should have won that race. And he went away for a month and a half, the last six weeks, and you know it because you told me you could -- and you're a friendly person, OK? You're perfect for Mitt Romney. He should have been on your show every night.

You told me four years ago you could not get him to do your show. He just wouldn't be available.

SEAN HANNITY: It was worse than that. The night of the third debate, I think I used every expletive that's ever been used in the history of mankind screaming at his campaign -- How could you let him go out there and debate that way?

(CROSSTALK)

He totally let down his guard, lost the election that night. And I knew it.

DONALD TRUMP: And the second debate wasn't good, but the third debate was a total disaster.

SEAN HANNITY: Well, I wanted -- but what bothers me about this, it sounds like some people, they see your success, you're leading in the polls going into tomorrow, that they're going to pout, they're going to pick up their toys and they might even support Hillary! That angers me as a conservative who is saying, Wait a minute. We've been asked to support Bob Dole and John McCain. They weren't conservative.

DONALD TRUMP: All right, so you and I both know sports very well, Sean. I know the boxing world very well and I've hired -- I've had so many boxers and so many matches.

When they go in -- a champion goes into an unfriendly territory because he's going to get a bigger purse if he goes to some other guy's hometown and you're going to get an unfriendly -- you know, you're going to get unfriendly judges. And you know the expression? Got to knock him out. If you knock him out, there's nobody can judge against you.

If I get enough delegates, we don't have to worry about conventions or anything else. Now...

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

Now, what was interesting -- because I am not a fan of Karl Rove. I think he's terrible. And no matter what I do, if I win New Hampshire by a landslide, I win Nevada by a landslide -- we killed everybody, as you know, including we won the evangelicals, everything, in South Carolina. It was so incredible.

And I'm watching this guy. It's almost like -- in fact, I jokingly called -- I called up a friend of yours at FOX. I said, Gee, I've been watching FOX. Do you think I won? I won by a landslide.

OK, but Karl Rove...

(CROSSTALK)

SEAN HANNITY: You weren't watching my show.

DONALD TRUMP: No, no. I know. Your show is great. But I called up Karl Rove the other night, you know, just a friend. And I'm watching Karl Rove. And he says, Donald Trump needs 300 points. And I said, That sounds reasonable. Then a friend said it's impossible to get 300 points.

So here's what's going to happen. If I get 240 or 250 or 260, which everybody would be thrilled at, he'll say, Donald Trump had a bad night because somebody said it's impossible to get 300.

So look, you got some bad people in FOX. You got some great people, too, but you got some bad people. And you're going to have...

(APPLAUSE)

SEAN HANNITY: Wait a minute. In all fairness...

(CROSSTALK)

Have you watched MSNBC? They suck.

(CROSSTALK)

DONALD TRUMP: But they do treat me well. And I have to tell you, I have great respect for FOX.

SEAN HANNITY: I know you do.

DONALD TRUMP: And you and O'Reilly...

SEAN HANNITY: Greta.

DONALD TRUMP: ... a little bit rough, and Greta, and so many others.

SEAN HANNITY: Neil Cavuto, "Fox & Friends"...

DONALD TRUMP: Steve Doocy, "Fox & Friends," the whole -- Brian...

(CROSSTALK)

SEAN HANNITY: Let me ask you this question...

DONALD TRUMP: No, no. I will tell you. You have a couple of people that shouldn't be on -- Stephen Hayes should not be on the shows. He shouldn't be on, he's so biased. Karl Rove -- still thinks Romney won. You remember after the election?

(LAUGHTER)

Romney won. Romney won. They had to pull him off the air. The election ended about four hours ago.

(APPLAUSE)

I'm telling you, Romney won. He shouldn't be on the air!

SEAN HANNITY: Let me go back to Hillary for a second because Hillary Clinton said -- this is a quote -- "Donald Trump saying America's not great again. We don't have to make America great. America is already great." Tell that to the 95 million Americans out of the labor force, the 50 million in poverty and the 46 million on food stamps. Aren't our fellow Americans suffering? I think they're suffering.

DONALD TRUMP: So she came out with a very strong (INAUDIBLE) because you know, our whole theme -- and you got a lot of hats out there that say it, "Make America great again." That's actually a positive thing, not a negative thing. That's a positive. To me, I -- you know, some people say it's negative. It's totally positive. And it's more positive now than when I first came up with it, frankly, because I've traveled all over. I mean, I was today in -- I'm going to Georgia here. I'm going to -- I'm going all over the place.

SEAN HANNITY: Alabama yesterday.

DONALD TRUMP: I was in Alabama. We had 35,000 people in Alabama. It was the most incredible crowd. It was the biggest crowd of the season -- for anybody.

(APPLAUSE)

Far bigger than any of the Bernie crowds. I mean, frankly, we can get 60,000 and 70,000 if we want to take a stadium. I don't even know if it's necessary.

But we went to Arkansas, where I think we're going to do great. It's a little bit of a closer one, to be honest, but I think we're going to do great in Arkansas.

Every place we go, we have something special. And I will tell you, I am so impressed with the people of this country. We have unbelievable people. Like these people. But we have -- no matter where we go, whether we go to Dallas -- I went to Dallas. Mark Cuban gave us the arena. It was so nice, where the Mavericks play -- 21,000 people. Filled it up in three days, packed. And I'm telling you, it was like a lovefest.

A friend of mine, Sean, said, How do you do that? How do you speak in front of all those people without notes or anything? I said, There is so much love in the room -- it's true -- that it's actually easy to do.

SEAN HANNITY: We'll take a break. We'll come back. More with 2016 Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump as "Hannity" continues from Georgia. Stay with us.

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

(NEWSBREAK)

Welcome back to "Hannity" as we continue with 2016 Republican presidential front-runner -- Donald Trump is with us. We're at Valdosta State University. You all having a good time?

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

I had an argument years ago with Vicente Fox when he was president of Mexico. And I said, What about all the illegals that are leaving your country and coming into ours? He would not acknowledge the term illegal immigrant. We had a big argument on TV, on this show.

DONALD TRUMP: OK.

SEAN HANNITY: And he called you a Nazi. Joe Biden apologized for you saying we've got to protect the country from drugs and crime.

What is your reaction to both of them?

DONALD TRUMP: Well, I watched. He also threw out the F-bomb. If you would have done it or if I would have done it, it would have been the end of your job. It would have been -- I don't know. I won't lose my job at least, but I would have been -- I would have gone through a big problem. You understand that.

He threw out that word. It was so disgusting. And you know, if you look at what he was really doing, he was indignant that somebody would actually tell him -- first of all, he's not even the president anymore -- but that somebody would tell Mexico that, you know, You're going to have to start coming along, because they -- and I get along with the Mexicans. I get along great with everybody and everything having to do with Mexico.

But they have been -- they have ripped off our country so badly, and China and Japan and India and Vietnam and any other country that you want to talk about.

We're going to make such great deals. We're going to change those deals. We're going to rip those deals up and we're going to have real trade deals done by Carl Icahn and the smartest people in business.

(APPLAUSE)

SEAN HANNITY: I've been down to the border for the FOX News Channel.

DONALD TRUMP: Right.

SEAN HANNITY: And I've been all the way from the Rio Grande to San Diego. I was in a drug warehouse bigger than this room, floor to ceiling drugs. I was in an office building in San Diego. A tunnel had been dug from Mexico.

DONALD TRUMP: Right.

SEAN HANNITY: I was there when gang members were arrested. Believe it or not, I was on horseback, all-terrain vehicle, helicopters...

DONALD TRUMP: Right.

SEAN HANNITY: ... and boats.

DONALD TRUMP: Right.

SEAN HANNITY: I've been down there 10 times. It is so dangerous, 600,000 crimes in Texas alone! Why don't people ever tell that side of the story?

DONALD TRUMP: Well, look, we're going to have a border. It's going to be a real border, and we're going to build a wall and it's going to be a serious wall. And it's going to be...

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

... a serious wall. Just remember that. And you remember I said it. And remember this also. Mexico, Sean, is going to pay for the wall.

You know, these politicians come up and they say, You don't really mean Mexico's going to pay. I'm a business guy. I've done unbelievable deals. You know, they talk about this deal, that deal. I've done hundreds of deals that are so good. Nobody ever wants to talk about the great deals. I've done unbelievable -- in fact, I filed my financials...

SEAN HANNITY: Right.

DONALD TRUMP: ... with the FE -- nobody believes how good they are, the federal elections. And you know, I'm very proud of it. And you can have -- we will have Mexico pay for that wall. And you know what? If I'm wrong about this, you can all come back. We'll have another meeting, and I'll apologize to you, OK?

(LAUGHTER)

Mexico -- it's going to be a serious wall. It's going to be a real wall. It's not going to be a wall that they just climb up, and you know, you see what they do, over.

SEAN HANNITY: The New York Times is claiming today that they had an off-the- record conversation with you in January. Off the record, by the way, now they're leaking it.

DONALD TRUMP: Yes, of course.

SEAN HANNITY: Typical media.

DONALD TRUMP: No, no. The most dishonest media group. And it's also failing. I call it the failing New York Times. It is doing so badly, it's dying. But I did, they had a -- we had a board meeting. It was off the record. All of a sudden, they leak it. It's all the over the place.

SEAN HANNITY: They said, Oh, you're -- that you're -- it's negotiable on the law.

DONALD TRUMP: Everything. By the way, it is negotiable. Things are negotiable. I'll be honest with you. You know, I'll make the wall two feet shorter or something.

(LAUGHTER)

I mean, everything's negotiable.

SEAN HANNITY: But it's not negotiable about building it.

DONALD TRUMP: I actually said -- I -- no, building it? Not negotiable.

SEAN HANNITY: It's not negotiable about -- would it be negotiable about the 11 million, maybe let some people stay if they register in a period of time?

DONALD TRUMP: I would say this. Look, I've always said we have some good people over here, and they're going to go out, but we will work out some system that's fair. But we either have a country or we don't. We need a border. We need a wall. We need a wall.

You know, I won New Hampshire, and they have a tremendous heroin problem. And I promised the people of New Hampshire we're going to stop that heroin from coming in. It's a very hard thing to kick. And they have tremendous -- we're going to work on the people that have the habit already, and we're going to try and get them better. We got to try and get them better. They have tremendous...

SEAN HANNITY: It's bad.

DONALD TRUMP: Of all the places, New Hampshire. It's, like, the first question I get all the time, the heroin problem. Comes right over the southern border. Not going to happen anymore. It's not going to happen anymore.

But there's always going to be some negotiation. I mean, whether the wall is 50 feet tall or 40 feet tall -- and one of the things one of the reporters said to me, they said, Well, what happens -- you know, Vicente Fox made this statement. How do you respond? Because it was an arrogant, terrible, horrible statement.

And I said, Here's how I respond. The wall just got 10 feet higher. And I meant it. And he was incensed. And then Joe Biden goes and -- he -- people -- look, Mexico's great. And the people are great because I have many, many Mexicans that...

SEAN HANNITY: (INAUDIBLE) on Joe -- on crazy uncle Joe. Go ahead.

DONALD TRUMP: I was just going to say, and Joe Biden goes and apologizes. For what? We have right now a $58 billion trade deficit with Mexico. That's why the wall gets built, by the way. That's why they're going to pay for it. The wall is going to cost -- listen to this...

SEAN HANNITY: Will the name Trump be on it?

DONALD TRUMP: Only if it's beautiful.

(LAUGHTER)

The wall -- the wall gets built. It's going to cost $10 billion to build the wall, OK. It's a lot of money. It's a wall. You know, great wall of China is 13,000 miles long. This is 1,000. We need 1,000. Of the 2,000, we need 1,000. It's going to cost $10 billion to build the wall. It's going to be a very terrific wall. But you know what? When you're losing $58 billion -- in other words, Mexico's making essentially $58...

SEAN HANNITY: It'll be part of...

DONALD TRUMP: ... $10 billion is not bad.

SEAN HANNITY: It'll be...

DONALD TRUMP: Part of the whole thing.

SEAN HANNITY: ... part of the trade bill.

DONALD TRUMP: A hundred percent (INAUDIBLE)

SEAN HANNITY: OK, we got to take a break. We'll come back. More with GOP front-runner Donald Trump as "Hannity" continues from Valdosta State University. We're in beautiful Georgia. Straight ahead.

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

Welcome back to "Hannity," and we are in Valdosta, Georgia, tonight with 2016 Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump.

All right, the other night during the debate -- and I had -- I had asked you this question a lot and I was -- and Marco Rubio was going hard at you on the issue of health care.

DONALD TRUMP: Yes.

SEAN HANNITY: And I don't think a lot of people understand where competition is instituted in state lines.

DONALD TRUMP: That's right.

SEAN HANNITY: Do you go as far as health care savings accounts?

DONALD TRUMP: I did. And I mentioned that.

SEAN HANNITY: Yes.

DONALD TRUMP: I talked about health care savings accounts. I said get rid of the lines, you're going to have competition. Then they said, Oh, be more specific. Let me tell you, the competition is going to make it specific. You're going to have hundreds of different deals. You're going to have many people coming in and competing. They're all going to be different.

SEAN HANNITY: (INAUDIBLE) buy a plan in Georgia.

DONALD TRUMP: Yes. Right now, you have no competition. There's no competition. When we open it up to competition, you're going to have tremendous -- I mean, it's going to be beautiful. You're going to have many, many different alternatives, things that you wouldn't even know about, things that you wouldn't have any idea about right now.

SEAN HANNITY: So in other words, the companies that offer the best deal...

DONALD TRUMP: Right.

SEAN HANNITY: ... at the best price...

DONALD TRUMP: Correct.

SEAN HANNITY: ... will get the most business.

DONALD TRUMP: To individual people, and companies.

SEAN HANNITY: So it's a free market system.

DONALD TRUMP: It's a free market system.

SEAN HANNITY: And you did get -- and a lot of people said -- I've never felt that as a conservative that people want people to die in the streets. I think we've always taken care of those that need help.

DONALD TRUMP: Yes.

SEAN HANNITY: Why did you get criticized for that?

DONALD TRUMP: I don't understand it. I must tell you. Look, there are going to be some people -- you can say free market, you can say it's going to be much cheaper. "Obamacare" is horrible. It's -- you know, your premiums are going up 45, 50 percent. It's a horror show.

SEAN HANNITY: Yes.

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

DONALD TRUMP: But look, where are -- and we're Republicans. Some of you are Republicans. It doesn't matter whether you're a Republican or not in this case. I'm not going to have, if I'm president, people dying in the street because they can't afford a health plan that's much less than "Obamacare," much less, Sean. But it's still going to cost something. You're going to have people that can't afford anything.

The people aren't going to be dying on the sidewalks and in the street, not if I'm president. So we'll work out a deal. We'll get them into the hospital. We'll get them in to see doctors, but...

SEAN HANNITY: And the government buys drugs in bulk. The government will...

DONALD TRUMP: They'll buy -- and things will be -- now, most people are going to be able to buy their plan. It's going to be a much better plan than they have now for a lot less.

SEAN HANNITY: Yes.

DONALD TRUMP: But I'm not going to allow people to die on the sidewalks in the street. And you know when I make that in a speech in front of all Republicans and -- I get standing ovations.

SEAN HANNITY: Yes.

DONALD TRUMP: I mean, it's crazy. Who wants to let that happen? I'm not going to let it happen.

SEAN HANNITY: Just for the benefit of time, an issue that came up in the debate, too, was the issue of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.

DONALD TRUMP: Right. Right.

SEAN HANNITY: You know, I look at the Palestinians -- here's Israel, '67, '73, Israel has offered everything but the moon to get peace with the Palestinians.

DONALD TRUMP: Right.

SEAN HANNITY: Children are indoctrinated to hate Israel and hate Jews. How is it ever going to be possible if that's the way...

DONALD TRUMP: I agree. It's very tough. It's going to be very tough. And I've had some of the greatest negotiators in the world tell me it's almost impossible because the Palestinians are ingrained with hatred toward Israel.

And what I say is -- I'm very pro-Israel, as you know. I've been -- I've been, you know...

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

You look -- I was the grand marshal of the Israeli Day parade at a time when it was very dangerous. They said, You have to be crazy to do it. I'm very, very pro-Israel. But at the same time, I don't want to be so negative on the other side because I would say that would be the ultimate deal, making peace between the Palestinians and Israel. I always say that may be the hardest deal in the world, all right? And I'll tell you...

SEAN HANNITY: But you recognize that there is this -- the neighbors of Israel hate them.

DONALD TRUMP: Oh, it's terrible. It's terrible. It's ingrained, and it's a very tough thing, but I'd like to give it a shot.

(CROSSTALK)

SEAN HANNITY: I'm going to ask you a last question...

DONALD TRUMP: It would be good for everybody. If we could make peace, that would be great.

SEAN HANNITY: It'd be great for the world.

DONALD TRUMP: Be great for the world.

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

SEAN HANNITY: Last question. We have a -- only a minute. ISIS, radical Islamic terrorism...

DONALD TRUMP: Right.

SEAN HANNITY: ... is the evil of our time. It's the Nazi Germany of our time.

DONALD TRUMP: Got to knock it out. We're going to knock it out. We're going to -- our military is very depleted. We're going to build up our military. Nobody's going to mess with us, and we're going to knock out ISIS.

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

SEAN HANNITY: Is this a lifelong struggle, do you think, against radical Islamists?

DONALD TRUMP: It certainly seems it. It's a horrible thing. Something's going on. And you know what I did with respect to Muslims. There's something going on and we don't know. It's a temporary halt. We have to have a temporary ban.

SEAN HANNITY: How many support that, by the way, in this crowd?

(APPLAUSE)

Do it by clapping. People on TV can't see all of you. All right.

Do you support a temporary ban until we can vet the people to come in?

(APPLAUSE)

Almost the whole crowd.

Mr. Trump, I know you got, like, 10,000, 20,000 people waiting for you. We really appreciate your time, as always.

DONALD TRUMP: Thank you, Sean.

SEAN HANNITY: Thank you so much.

Give it up for Mr. Donald Trump.

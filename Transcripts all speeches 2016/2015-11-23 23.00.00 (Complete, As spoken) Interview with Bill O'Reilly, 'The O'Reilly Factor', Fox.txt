BILL O'REILLY: And, in the "Impact Segment" tonight, let us get right to Republican Presidential Candidate, Donald Trump, joins us now from his headquarters in Manhattan. First of all, I need some clarity on a few issues. Let us start with the Muslim registry controversy. What do you want there? What is your vision?

DONALD TRUMP: Well, it is very simple. When they come in from Syria, guest of President Obama, we should not be taking any because we have no idea where they come from, who they are. They have no paperwork. There is no way of proving that their paperwork is correct. When they come in from Syria. I want them to be registered. They have to be registered.

We have to watch them, because we just do not know who they are. We do not know where they come from. We do not know if they are ISIS, and we do not know if they have evil intentions. So, I want them registered.

BILL O'REILLY: All right. But they will be if they get papers to come here. ICE Home Security will know who they are, will know where they go. So, what you want is a reality already, is it not?

DONALD TRUMP: No. What I want is I do not want them to come here --

BILL O'REILLY: All right. OK.

DONALD TRUMP: We should not be taking anybody. We should do --

BILL O'REILLY: OK.

DONALD TRUMP: -- well, we should not do it, because we have no idea -- ICE, do you believe in ICE. Look what happened to Kate. You know Kate very well. What happened in -- Probably, better than most -- what happened in San Francisco --

BILL O'REILLY: I do not have any confidence they can vet them.

DONALD TRUMP: -- and so many others.

BILL O'REILLY: I do not have any confidence they can vet them.

DONALD TRUMP: Yes. They have no -- they will not vet them properly.

BILL O'REILLY: But, if it were me, and I were running as a republican, instead of saying, "I do not want them," I would say, "I will take some women and Children, and they have to be properly vetted by the FBI, not Homeland Security, because we do not trust them. But I will take some women and children, who are languishing in these camps." That puts a humane face on it, and does not put us in danger, would not that be smartest strategy?

DONALD TRUMP: Well, I will tell you. You mean children like we took in Boston, the two brothers that did so much damage during the Boston Marathon. They were very young when they came here and you see what happened to them. I would not say they would nice -- they were radicalized.

BILL O'REILLY: No, but this is homegrown -- all the terrorism that took place in Charleston was homegrown. You are never going to have a guarantee. You just want to put a face on the Republican Party that you are not just mean guys and that is what the Democrats are trying to do to you.

DONALD TRUMP: Hey, Bill. I would do something much different, much different. I would do a free zone, safe zone in Syria. I would get other people in other countries to support us --

BILL O'REILLY: Who, would, though? Who would do that?

DONALD TRUMP: Because frankly, we cannot keep putting up -- well, like the Gulf States. You got to get them to put up, because they are putting up nothing. The Gulf States have money. They are not taking anybody. They are not putting up much money. They have more money than anybody.

We do not have any money. We are a debtor nation. We owe $19 trillion. This will cause us when we take all of these people, and believe me, it does not stop at 10,000. This will cost us billions of dollars over a ten-year period, and we cannot do it.

BILL O'REILLY: All right. We have the same vision about --

DONALD TRUMP: We just do not know enough about it.

BILL O'REILLY: We have the same vision about safe zones inside Syria, but I am working through NATO. You have not mentioned NATO. Why not?

DONALD TRUMP: I think NATO would be fine. I think it is great. I think it is certainly makes it a little bit easier. If you declare war, you go through NATO, but I would add a lot of countries, frankly to the NATO group that we already have, so I think it is fine.

BILL O'REILLY: Yes. If you could persuade -- to pick up the tab here and there, that would be a good thing, and you think you could do that?

DONALD TRUMP: Well, it would be nice. I mean they do have plenty of money, OK?

BILL O'REILLY: All right.

DONALD TRUMP: It would be nice if they contribute it. And, by the way, so should many other countries contribute; but that way, they are in their country. You know, I read a case where some people are sent to Minnesota. It was 10 degrees below zero. They go from Syria to Minnesota. Not exactly so great. They probably want to be there. You do a safe zone --

BILL O'REILLY: Well, it does not matter what they want.

DONALD TRUMP: You do a free zone.

BILL O'REILLY: If you have a safe zone in your own country, they stay there. It does not matter what they want. OK. Are you aware --

DONALD TRUMP: It is a much better idea and certainly better for us.

BILL O'REILLY: Are you aware that the liberal media and the Democratic Party in general, trying to paint you as a racist? Are you aware of that?

DONALD TRUMP: I think so. But, I think people know better than that.

BILL O'REILLY: OK. All right.

DONALD TRUMP: I am probably the least racist person on earth.

BILL O'REILLY: Well, I have known you a long time.

DONALD TRUMP: I think people know better than that.

BILL O'REILLY: And, I never saw any racism from you. However, when you tweet out a thing, and this bothered me, I got to tell you. You tweeted out that whites killed by blacks, these are statistics you picked up somewhere at a rate of 81 percent. And, that is totally wrong, whites killed by blacks is 15 percent. You tweeted it was 81 percent. Now --

DONALD TRUMP: Bill, I did not tweet. I re-tweeted somebody that was supposedly an expert and was also a radio show.

BILL O'REILLY: Yes. But, you do not want to be -- why do you want to be in that zone?

DONALD TRUMP: Hey, Bill. Bill, am I going to check every statistic? I get millions and millions of people.

BILL O'REILLY: You got to. You are a presidential contender, you got to check it.

DONALD TRUMP: I have millions of people. You know what? Fine. But, this came out of radio shows and everything else.

BILL O'REILLY: Oh, come on! Radio shows?

DONALD TRUMP: All of it was a re-tweet. It did not say -- excuse me, all it was is a re-tweet. It was not from me. And, it did. It came out of radio show --

BILL O'REILLY: It would have been better.

DONALD TRUMP: -- because you see all the names.

BILL O'REILLY: Look, you know I am looking out for you, right? You know that? I am looking out for you. I look out for every honest politician. I do not care what party they are in. Do not do this. Do not put your name on stuff like this, because it makes the other side -- It gives them stuff to tell the ill informed voter that you are a racist. I mean, you just handed them a platter.

DONALD TRUMP: Well, this was a re-tweet. Bill, I am sure you are looking out for me.

BILL O'REILLY: All right.

DONALD TRUMP: Everybody is, right?

BILL O'REILLY: Yes.

(LAUGHING)

DONALD TRUMP: This was a re-tweet.

BILL O'REILLY: Yes.

DONALD TRUMP: This was a re-tweet.

BILL O'REILLY: All right, whatever it is --

DONALD TRUMP: And, it came from sources that are very credible --

BILL O'REILLY: I told you, you should not tweet ever.

DONALD TRUMP: What can I tell you.

BILL O'REILLY: You should not be tweeting. Do not tweet. Give it up for lent.

DONALD TRUMP: All right. Sure.

BILL O'REILLY: Lent is coming soon.

DONALD TRUMP: OK.

BILL O'REILLY: Give it up. All right, final question.

DONALD TRUMP: You know what, I like it -- Can I tell you what? I like it because I can get, also, my point of view out there. And, my point of view is very important to a lot of people that are looking at me.

BILL O'REILLY: All right.

DONALD TRUMP: And, as far as what they have done in terms of me, you just had poll --

BILL O'REILLY: Got it.

DONALD TRUMP: -- wait a minute. You just had a poll and going even against Hillary, I win easily. I think you can see that, it was in a FOX poll that just came out.

BILL O'REILLY: Well, your favorite guy, Karl Rove has that poll two segments away or even -- I do not know -- yes, it is two segments away and we have all the numbers. Final question.

DONALD TRUMP: Well, let me just say something. Wait a minute. Let me just say something. Karl Rove spent over $400 million trying to win races for the republicans. $400 million, he did not win a race.

BILL O'REILLY: Why do not you try to win him over --

DONALD TRUMP: Karl Rove should not even be on your program.

BILL O'REILLY: Why do not you win him over?

DONALD TRUMP: I do not want to win him. He fought for so many people and lost every single one.

BILL O'REILLY: All right.

DONALD TRUMP: I do not have to win him over.

BILL O'REILLY: All right.

DONALD TRUMP: I do not want to win him over, not after what he says about me. It is totally biased. He should not be on your show, frankly.

BILL O'REILLY: But, we have the poll numbers and they cannot be biased because they are straight numbers. I want to talk to you about NATO --

DONALD TRUMP: But, who is leading in the polls?

BILL O'REILLY: -- But we are going to do that --

DONALD TRUMP: Bill, who is leading --

BILL O'REILLY: You are.

DONALD TRUMP: Bill, who is leading in the poll?

BILL O'REILLY: You are. You.

DONALD TRUMP: All right. Good.

BILL O'REILLY: Donald Trump.

DONALD TRUMP: I think Karl Rove thinks Mitt Romney is still leading in the poll. OK. Good. I am leading, that is true.

(LAUGHING)

BILL O'REILLY: You are leading in the poll.

DONALD TRUMP: Good.

BILL O'REILLY: All right. You also have a book out.

DONALD TRUMP: Explain that to Karl Rove.

BILL O'REILLY: Crippled America, right? It is doing pretty well, the book?

DONALD TRUMP: All right.

BILL O'REILLY: Anything else you want me to do?

DONALD TRUMP: And, it is doing well, "Crippled America".

BILL O'REILLY: Anything else you want me to do?

DONALD TRUMP: No, nothing else. Just be fair. Just be fair.

BILL O'REILLY: Always fair.

DONALD TRUMP: All I ask is fairness. Level playing field. All I asked 0-

BILL O'REILLY: I am Mr. Fairness. You are looking at him right here.

DONALD TRUMP: Yes. OK. OK.

BILL O'REILLY: All right. We always appreciate you coming on, Donald.

DONALD TRUMP: Thank you very much.

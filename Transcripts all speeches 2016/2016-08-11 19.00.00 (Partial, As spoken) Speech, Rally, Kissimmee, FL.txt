DONALD TRUMP: Barack Obama is the founder -- hey, if he would have -- folks, we should have never been in Iraq. We were going to destabilize the Middle East. I said it, I was a civilian. Nobody cares. I was a civilian. Nobody cares.

We should have never been in. They should have understood it. They made a mistake. But we should have never ended it the way they ended it. By ending it the way he ended it, and he got everybody out and he let them know when and we're leaving and they just sat back, they just sat back and they went in.

And I'll tell you why. Barack Obama, number one, is incompetent and, number two, remember this, number two, he is the founder in a true sense. If he would have stayed -- I didn't want to be there, but if he would have kept a relatively small force, he probably could have prevented ISIS from forming.

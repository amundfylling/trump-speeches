DONALD TRUMP: You know, I have been watching these speeches at night, and, boy am I getting hit. Boom, boom, boom.

(LAUGHTER)

I am getting hit and they don't mean it. And there is a lot of lies being told, but I guess they have to do their thing. I guess they have to do their thing.

But I will say this. We had, we had a tremendously successful convention in Cleveland. Cleveland was amazing. Cleveland was amazing.

(APPLAUSE)

And they call it a bounce, but we had a bounce like very few people have a bounce. All I know is I'm leading in the polls. We are leading in all of these polls.

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

And we're going to make America great again. But I watched last night. We're going to make America better than ever before. Believe me.

But I watched last night, and they are not talking about the real world, you know. They are not talking about radical Islamic terrorism. They are not talking about borders where people just pour across. They are not talking about the crime, the kind of crime that we have in this nation. They are not talking about the fact that many people in our country are making less money today in terms of real wages than they were making 18 years ago. They are not talking about that.

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

They are not talking about the fact that our jobs are leaving our country. That our jobs are pouring in to Mexico and other countries. They don't talk about that. They don't talk about all of the problems we have with education, where we're ranked very, very poorly. And they're not talking about that. They just don't talk about it.

So I'm watching -- everything is hunky dory. Everything is wonderful. They're not talking about ISIS and what ISIS is doing, and our depleted military where our military isn't being properly funded and it's being depleted.

They're not talking about Obamacare where in Texas they just had, going through Blue Cross/Blue Shield, a 60 per cent -- six-oh -- a 60 per cent increase.

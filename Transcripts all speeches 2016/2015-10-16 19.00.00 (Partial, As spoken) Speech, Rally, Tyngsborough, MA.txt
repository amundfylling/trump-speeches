DONALD TRUMP: Amazing, really amazing. I want to thank you all. It's great to be here. We had some big news today. A lot of good news. First of all, you know Hillary was right down the street.

(CROWD BOOING)

She had -- listen to this. Would you say -- would you say we have 4,000 people at least tonight? At least. So we have two rooms like this full, we have at least I guess 2,000 people outside. And Hillary had 250 people. That's not good. That's not good. Well, I'll tell you what. I love the area, I love -- I love Massachusetts. I love --

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

Why do they always say that a republican can't win Massachusetts? I think we can. You know why? I think that the Democrats are so sick and tired of watching our country lose that they're going to vote for the republican if this is the one. I really believe that. And we love, love, love New Hampshire. We love it. You know, -- so about ten minutes ago they just gave me some result. You know, somebody says, you really like polls. Yes. I like them because I'm winning. You know when you're not winning you don't like them as much. But we're really winning. We're winning everything. Everything. Every state. We're winning everything.

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

We're winning everything. So this just came in. Reuters, 33 for Trump. Thirty three percent. Remember what that means. If 15 people in addition to myself. We have 16. If you get 33, you know, somebody said, oh, I think he's peaked. I think he's peaked. They constantly say it, he's peaked! I hear this every week. You know, we go up up up. And then we go down one point, it's like -- it's like we're on the "Titanic." Oh, it's unbelievable. Three weeks ago we went down a point, it was like oh, it's over. Then we went up two points, they don't report that. Then we went up five points so here it comes out, look at this, Reuters, good Reuters, good, professional, good? Oh, Jeremy, I wish you'd tell the truth. CNN, CNN.

(CROWD BOOING)

All right. What are you going to do? What are you going to do? You know I told him last time it was very interesting. We were -- such a great success. It was so great. You saw it. Three nights ago. We had 8,000 people maybe. There were eight demonstrators. No, no, it was true. You say saw it the other night. Eight demonstrators. And they started, you know, shouting a little bit. And they were gone very quickly. And, you know, it's freedom of speech, you can do it. And I said to the people, 8,000 people. And I said, here's the bad part. They'll be the story. And I thought I could talk the press out of it by saying that. Next day, demonstrations, at Trump -- I'm telling you we had eight people.

And two of them asked for my autograph when I was going out. No, it's true! These were not violent demonstrators. These were nice people. But anyway. So Reuters comes out, we're 33. Carson's at 15 in second place. Think of it. That's a big difference. That's a big difference. Then you have other people. Actually Carly is way down. Wow! What's going on? She went way down. But you have Rubio is way lower. Way lower. But if he goes up two points, Rubio surges! No, I had it in Florida. You know we're winning Florida. Can you believe it? I love Florida. So we're winning Florida. And they had a poll and I was 29 and they were -- your governor and your sitting senator, they were like 11 and 14 or 15.

And one of them went up a little bit. And they talked about Bush and Rubio headline doing better. And I said, oh, that's too bad. I guess I got wiped out. I must be way down. So, I'm reading the story. I get to paragraph three. And I said, why Mr. Trump is at 29? Wait a minute, I'm at 29, they're at 11 and something. But that's the dishonesty of the press. You have no idea how dishonest these people are.

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

You have no idea. No, you have no idea. It's brutal. It's brutal. You get -- actually, it's so bad, it's so bad last night I watched Megyn Kelly. I haven't watched her in a long time. And you had these two clowns on. One Stirewalt and another one, the other one is a speechwriter for George Bush. How can you be a speechwriter for George Bush? I mean, I like George Bush. He's a nice man but I don't necessarily want to write speeches for him. So he's saying -- he actually said, something to the effect that, yes, Carson's tied or winning on all -- and it's not even close. And you can't do anything. Except one thing I can do. Actually said that Carson -- who's a nice guy. By way he's a guy. He really is.

But they actually said that Carson is tied or winning in all the polls. And I'm saying, you know, on my Twitter, I had people that went crazy. That it's a total lie, Mr. Trump. It -- they wanted like a revolution. And it is a total lie. But they have these two puppets that work for her and they say these things and it's incredible. So, here's the polls. In New Jersey, now, remember Reuters is national. Thirty three, second place is 15, right? Here's the state of New Jersey, great place, I love New Jersey. Got some problems. To be honest. It's got some problems. Trump, 32. Second place, 13. OK. Then I hear that like I'm tied, I'm not tied. We're killing everybody. Actually --

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

No, it's true. It's true. It's true. Peggy Noonan has been great. I think she's fantastic. She's a great writer. And that's only because for the last three weeks she's written great. But tomorrow she writes a story which I saw tonight and she talks about that we're sort of levelled out. And I think it -- oh, that's a terrible story. Can you imagine being levelled out is a bad story. You know what levelled out means? It means that I haven't gone up in the last couple of weeks. But, you know, it's hard to go when you're at 33, 32, 35. And then inside the story, she said he had a great week with the polls.

And I say, how can I say levelled out? Maybe it was a bad guy who wrote the headline. And I said, well, wait, how are we levelled out? Then they talked about Nevada. Where I'm up at 38 percent and win the Hispanics. Can you believe it?

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

And Peggy -- and remember I like her a lot. I think she's great. And then she said, great week but the title was not so good. And then -- so Nevada, she said, great week. Some at 38. And then at South Carolina, I'm at 36, right? And then in Connecticut, which just came out. That's Quinnipiac. Great pollster. I'm at 34 to 14. And she puts these in. And I'm saying, how did that level out? It's the press. And then oh, and then a Romney person -- you know we all like Romney, right? But he should have won. Give me a break. I supported him. I supported McCain. I supported these people.

And this time I said you know what, did you ever have it like you're with your wife, you're with your husband and you're really competent. And you're tired of seeing things done wrong. And you just say, you know, this time I'm just going to do it myself. Do you understand that?

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

I mean, we should have won that last election. We should have won. But, you know, he doesn't like me too much. I backed him and everything else. But I was so upset that he lost an election that should have been won. So they have Romney's guy going on his -- his manager is going on, he's selling a book. The guy is incompetent. He is talking about this -- then you have somebody else. You have his pollster, or a person who -- and he's the one that gave them the idea. He said I think he's flattened out. And because of that I end up with a headline. Even though they're copying all the other polls. So, listen, so you have 33 to 15 national. You have 32 to 13. You have 38 to like 11 in Nevada. South Carolina, a great place. And by the way, they're back. They have -- they have weathered that unbelievable flood.

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

They have weathered that flood. They actually asked if I'd do a commercial for them, can you believe it? South Carolina and Charleston. They said, would you do a commercial? I said, I get a million dollars but for you I'm going to do it for free. I did a free commercial. OK? We sent it, because what they've done, they're great people. By the way, South Carolina we're doing so great. Thirty six percent to like, forget, I won't even mention what's second because it's embarrassing. And then you have -- then you listen to these television shows where you're like, tied. So anyway, all lies, all lies. But I made a commercial for them. They are unbelievable. What they went through and they're back. You know, they're back. They're great people. They're hardworking and incredible people. So I've gotten to know so many.

So, here's one I love, did you ever hear of a state New Hampshire, right? How about this one? Trump 32, second place, 13.

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

Now, if the second place -- I won't use the name, but if the second -- and a nice person by the way. I don't dislike all of these people. Although I usually do dislike my enemies, OK? You know, when you're competing, you sort of want to win. But second place is nice.

But if the second place went from 10 to 13 and even though I'm 32 in New Hampshire, they'll say whoever it is is surging. It's amazing. Just very dishonest. Then, Quinnipiac, Connecticut, we went over 34.

How, here's a beautiful thing. So, this is sort of emblematic of everything. This came out in the polls. And it's done by CNN whose cameras all lit up back there. You believe, every time I make a speech, they have me on live television, no, it's terrible. I said to my people -- I don't want to do live television every time. And then if you repeat the story, it's like oh, he said that three nights ago.

You know, these other people like Hillary, she goes around. She has 250 people down the road in Keene, where by the way, last two weeks ago we had 4,000 people in Keene, right? Four thousand. Forget about here. We have 4,000 in Keene, the same area.

But it's sort of amazing, isn't it? But you know what's so important right here, they go over the different categories, how does he win? This one is Nevada. But it was also the same thing, pretty much the same numbers.

It was really amazing numbers, same numbers in South Carolina, done by CNN a couple of days ago. In fact, CNN called and said, your numbers are unbelievable. I said, "I agree. I can't believe it."

So they have -- who going to be your first choice, who's going to win for president? Trump, 38 percent. Pretty good.

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

And then they have one that's slightly important. It's called who's going to be best for the economy? Do you agree, that's important? We have to get all these young people -- we have to get them working. Right? Like him, like him. Like her.

We have to get them working, right? Got to have jobs when they're ready. So, on the economy, listen to this one. Trump is 67.

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

When I say 67, I mean, 67 percent. That's big. How do you have 67 percent when you have 16 people, right? You know, 67 percent would be amazing if you like me and somebody else, do you agree with that? That's a called a landslide. There's no such thing. It's true.

But how do you have 67 percent -- 67 out of 100? How do you have 67 percent when you have 16 people running? It's very hard. I mean, you have to be good. In fact, it's great for my ego. I will tell you, it's economy.

Remember the expression it's the economy, stupid, well, then the election is over. They all say how important. Well, nothing more important.

I mean, look, defense is more important to me. Defense is -- and I do great on defense.

(BREAK)

Bobby Jindal. I mean, you look at, that's Alfred E. Newman. Do have heard about Alfred E. Newman? "Mad Magazine"? Bobby Jindal, I swear, he looks just like him. It's true. Think about that, right? And that's true? The guy has zero.

Pataki, he couldn't be elected dogcatcher. He's got zero.

Lindsey Graham comes after me. Who nice guy and then comes after me. A month ago, goes from five to zero so far everybody that's come after me has gone down, right? Isn't that amazing?

Why do they keep going? There is something I don't understand. If I was one of them, I would crawl quietly out. I'd probably tweet. I've decided to get out of the race. I wouldn't have a news conference. Now it's true. I tweet, I decided, I'm going to get out of the race. And then, I'd sneak out to someplace with my wife and just go away.

They have zero. Zero and now they will go in the child stage. You know the child stage, they call it the "Children's Stage". That's for the debate. That's an incredible thing.

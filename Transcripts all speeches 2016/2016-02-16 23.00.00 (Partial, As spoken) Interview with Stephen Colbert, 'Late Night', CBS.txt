STEPHEN COLBERT: let's talk about what experts are calling you potty mouth. I can think of off the top of my heads, three things that you have said on air that this is true, CBS will not let me repeat or they would have to bleep them. How are you going to stop?

DONALD TRUMP: Well, it's easy, I have decided to stop -- I mean, I do that for emphasis and I do that sometimes nonpolitically. And when I -- once I decided to run for office I sort of said, well, we're going to have to stop.

STEPHEN COLBERT: But you didn't stop.

DONALD TRUMP: We'll lose the crowd.

STEPHEN COLBERT: You didn't stop running for office. You didn't stop.

DONALD TRUMP: No. But these are very minor words. And in many cases, I actually bleep them out myself. I never said the word and then they'll bleep it and people will think I said the word, which is a little deceptive, but that's OK.

(LAUGHTER)

STEPHEN COLBERT: I've got a suggestion. Why don't you have a swear jar, every time you say a bad word, you put $1 billion in it.

(LAUGHTER)

DONALD TRUMP: Yes. I think that's a good idea. I want to do that. I like that.

STEPHEN COLBERT: You're down in South Carolina. I'm from South Carolina. I want to help you out here. Let's hear you say, "Please vote for me, y'all".

DONALD TRUMP: Well, I can say that. Please vote for me, y'all.

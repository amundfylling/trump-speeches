GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: You said at the beginning if you run, you'll win. Do you still feel that?

MELANIA TRUMP: I feel that. I feel that. I see the connection with the American people and my husband, and -- he created a movement. It was nothing like that ever. And the crowd and the people that are behind him, it's unbelievable to see.

GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Does it make you wanna get out there yourself and help him out the final two weeks?

MELANIA TRUMP: We will see. My priority is my son, Barron, our son, Barron. And -- I support him 100 percent, and I'm there for him every time he needs me. And -- I might join him. We will see.

DONALD TRUMP: And she's actually going to make two or three speeches.

MELANIA TRUMP: Oh. (LAUGH)

DONALD TRUMP: And I will tell you --

GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Made some news right there.

DONALD TRUMP: No, it is. It's -- she's amazing when she speaks. She's amazing. And it's not what she does. I mean, she was very, very successful, but not as a public speaker. She's an amazing public speaker, so -- she's agreed to do two or three speeches. And I think it's going to be big speeches, important speeches.

GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: You mentioned b --

DONALD TRUMP: And I think it's gonna be great.

GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: You mentioned Barron. And I wonder, you know, we're gonna be talking to the other kids in just a minute. How has the experience been for him? He -- he's heard his father say a lotta tough things, heard a lotta tough things said about his father. How does he take it all in?

MELANIA TRUMP: I teach him, I explain to him so he knows what's going on. And -- he's -- he's taking very well. I keep him balanced and -- just have him a childhood as normal as possible. And he's enjoying his school and his sports. He's a great athlete. And I just want to have him -- out of the spotlight for now.

GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Does he ask you about the news, though?

MELANIA TRUMP: Yes, all the time. He ask me about the polls all the time, and --

DONALD TRUMP: It's very cute.

GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: It's like his dad, he follows the polls --

DONALD TRUMP: How is he doing in the polls?

MELANIA TRUMP: He's -- of course, he misses his dad -- a lot at these days. But -- he's doing great.

GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: And if you could look back over this campaign and say two things, what has been the best moment, what's been the worst?

MELANIA TRUMP: The best moment -- the movement that he created, and to show the people what he wants to do for the country. And the worst I would say, dishonest media and unfair media.

GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: You guys talk about this a lot. What -- what is so unfair about what's -- about the coverage, overall?

DONALD TRUMP: Well, I -- I can just speak for myself that I don't wanna mention any specific act, but so often they'll say, "Oh, Donald Trump said this or he said that." And what I said wasn't wrong, what I said was fine. If a Democrat had said it, if Hillary had said it, people would have -- they wouldn't have even thought about it.

But I'll say something that's absolutely perfect, George, and the next day it's headlines. "Donald Trump said this or that." Now, I know --

GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: That comes with the territory though, doesn't it?

DONALD TRUMP: No, no, no. Look, I went to an Ivy League school. I was a good student. I'm a very smart person. I -- I know what I'm saying. Now, there have been some instances where I could have done it a little bit differently, but sometimes I'll say something that's absolutely perfect, and I'll get a call after an interview like with you, "Oh, did you say this or that?" And they'll skew it so unfairly.

GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: But people see it for themselves, they make up their own minds --

DONALD TRUMP: Well, they don't really. Because what happens is you poison their minds. You really do. The media poisons the mind of the American voter. They really do, it's unfair. But the thing is, the American voter is really smart. I mean, I'm gonna see how smart they are. But the American voter, I -- I think the American voter is smarter than the media.

GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: It's clear you both feel very, very strongly -- about this. Clearly, you know, we all know and you've answered some questions about this since that Access Hollywood tape came out. He apologized to you for that, but you said at the third debate you didn't apologize to her about the women. Was that OK with you?

MELANIA TRUMP: They were -- they were lies. And as I said before, all the accusations, they should -- be handled in a court of law.

GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: So you believe the lawsuits should go forward.

MELANIA TRUMP: Yes, I believe that. And because to accuse somebody -- without evidence, it's very hurtful, and it's very damaging and unfair. And -- but honestly, do we still need to talk about that? I think American people wanna hear the problems that we have in America.

DONALD TRUMP: She's so right about that. She's so right about that --

MELANIA TRUMP: They -- they -- they wanna hear what we will do to make America better. Let's talk about jobs. Let's talk about secure our border. That's what American people wanna hear about it --

DONALD TRUMP: I think -- I think -- people -- just to finish, I can't apologize for something I didn't do. That nothing ever took place --

GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: But it's more likely to go away if you don't sue.

DONALD TRUMP: We'll see what happens, OK? Let's see what happens on the 8th, November 8th.

GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Have you thought more about what you'd like to do as first lady?

MELANIA TRUMP: I will focus on helping children and women, and also about social media. In this -- 21st century, what's going on, it's very hurtful to children. To some adults as well, but we need to take care of children --

GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Hard to keep it away from your kids.

MELANIA TRUMP: It is, but we need to teach them how to use it, what is right to say, what is not right to say. And -- because it's very bad out there. And children get hurt.

GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: By?

MELANIA TRUMP: By social media. By what's going on and by negativity.

GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Do you give him advice about tweets?

MELANIA TRUMP: Yes, I do. All the time. (LAUGH)

DONALD TRUMP: Well, and look, it's a modern day form of communication, George. And, you know, I have -- between Facebook and Twitter, I have 25 million people. It's a m -- it's a big asset. You have to use it right, but it's a big asset --

GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: But she'll tell you when you use it wrong?

DONALD TRUMP: And she -- she can give me very good (LAUGH) advice, believe me. But what she's saying is true though. I've seen so many people hurt so badly. Not just children, I mean, just people are hurt so badly by new social media. And she feels very strongly about it. She understands it very well --

GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: I'm sure you've seen this --

DONALD TRUMP: -- and it's very dangerous for children.

GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: -- the New York Times, what, it had three or four pages, all the people they say you've insulted on Twitter --

DONALD TRUMP: Well, that's OK. That's OK. Most of 'em deserved it. Were you one of 'em?

GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Actually I wasn't. I was -- I was a little surprised at that --

DONALD TRUMP: Oh, you should be -- I'm surprised. Let's go check it, I can't believe I didn't include you. No, look, I believe in fighting back. When people are against me, when they tell lies, you know, I have the power of this -- this instrument. And frankly, sometimes I'll use that. And I agree, sometimes it will revert back.

Or sometimes maybe it doesn't come out. You have to be careful with it.

GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: What do you think about Hillary Clinton? Not as a candidate, I know you believe that Mr. Trump will be a better president of the United States. But what do you think of her as a person?

MELANIA TRUMP: I don't know her that well. I think she's out there fighting. I think -- it's -- political -- machine behind it, behind her. She's protected a lot. And -- they will not say everything what needs to be said.

GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: And finally, you're OK with what happens no matter how the vote goes on November 8th?

MELANIA TRUMP: Yes, the life goes on no matter what happens.

GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: But he's gonna win?

MELANIA TRUMP: I think so. We're fighting till the end.

GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Thank you both.

MELANIA TRUMP: Thank you --

DONALD TRUMP: Thank you very much. Thank you.

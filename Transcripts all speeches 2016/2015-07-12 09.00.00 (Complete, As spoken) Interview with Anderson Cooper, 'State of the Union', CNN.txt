ANDERSON COOPER: The Washington Post  as you know, say that some of the workers building this beautiful hotel that you're building down in Washington, D.C., are illegal. They talked to 15 workers. They said a number of those 15 came here legally.

Through asylum, they are now legal, but that a number of them did say they are illegal. Isn't it hypocritical for you, saying that illegal immigration is killing this country, to be employing illegal immigrants?

DONALD TRUMP: Well, I read the story.

And, by the way, that story does not name any names. I would love for them if they could give us the names. But they said they spoke to one or two, and -- but they don't name them. They don't even know if it's true.

ANDERSON COOPER: Well, what they say is several of the men who hail mostly from El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala have earned citizenship or legal status through immigration programs targeting Central Americans fleeing civil wars or natural disasters. Others quietly acknowledge that they remain in the country illegally.

(CROSSTALK)

DONALD TRUMP: They have to give us the names, because we have...

(CROSSTALK)

ANDERSON COOPER: They are not going to give you names.

DONALD TRUMP: No, no, no, they have to give us the names.

And I have to say this. We believe so strongly -- I hired a very big contractor, one of the most prestigious, one of the best in the world, to build the building. It's their responsibility to make sure. They have...

(CROSSTALK)

ANDERSON COOPER: Doesn't the buck stop with you, though?

DONALD TRUMP: Yes, it does.

ANDERSON COOPER: You're paying their salary.

DONALD TRUMP: Oh, absolutely.

We have gone out of way to make sure that everybody in that building is legal, and we do have some that were -- that became legal. And wait a minute. We have some, many, I think, that became -- frankly, me, you, everybody, I mean, ultimately, we were all sort of in the group of immigrant, right?

ANDERSON COOPER: Right.

DONALD TRUMP: But we have done that to the absolute letter of the law. We're very, very careful.

(CROSSTALK)

ANDERSON COOPER: But if The Washington Post  can go there and talk to 15 people and find some illegal immigrants...

DONALD TRUMP: They haven't shown us anything. I wish they would give us some names. We would get them out immediately.

ANDERSON COOPER: But you have got a guy -- you must have a guy on the job site.

DONALD TRUMP: We have more than one guy.

ANDERSON COOPER: Yes.

DONALD TRUMP: And we check it probably more carefully than ever job that was ever built.

ANDERSON COOPER: Let me read you what some of your fellow Republicans have said.

Bush says: "Trump is wrong in this. He's doing this. He's not a stupid guy. Don't think he thinks every Mexican crossing the border is a rapist. He's doing this to inflame and incite and to draw attention."

DONALD TRUMP: So, look, Bush is weak on immigration. Forget about his stance on Common Core, which is a total disaster. He's very weak on immigration. And that's his prerogative, if he wants to be.

ANDERSON COOPER: Marco Rubio: "Trump's comments are not just offensive and inaccurate, but also divisive."

DONALD TRUMP: Marco Rubio is somebody who is extremely weak on immigration. He all of a sudden toughens his stance because his poll numbers went down. If he ever got elected, you would have people flowing across the border.

ANDERSON COOPER: Ted Cruz, who has backed you up on immigration...

DONALD TRUMP: Well, I have great respect for the fact that he had the courage to back me up and to say that what I'm saying is right.

And all I'm saying and all he's saying is that we have to stop illegal immigration.

ANDERSON COOPER: How much has this cost you? I mean..

DONALD TRUMP: A lot. Oh, it cost me a lot.

ANDERSON COOPER: Can you put a dollar figure on the loss of...

(CROSSTALK)

DONALD TRUMP: It is a lot of money. But, fortunately, I am very rich. It doesn't matter to me. Does it matter? No. What matters to me is making America great again.

ANDERSON COOPER: You don't have a dollar figure, this is costing you X amount?

DONALD TRUMP: No. But it's -- you know, it is sort of -- sort of funny.

One of them was, big headline, "Trump loses NASCAR." You know what they were doing? They were renting a ballroom from me for one night.

ANDERSON COOPER: And they already have...

(CROSSTALK)

DONALD TRUMP: There's a banquet hall. And they left a deposit. And now I have it rented already to somebody else.

ANDERSON COOPER: So, is it just small potatoes or is it -- is...

(CROSSTALK)

DONALD TRUMP: There was another one. There was another one.

Fortunately, it is not big for

ANDERSON COOPER: I think I know the answer to this question. Would you accept a vice presidential position...

DONALD TRUMP: No.

ANDERSON COOPER: ... if it didn't work out for you for president?

DONALD TRUMP: Would I -- look...

ANDERSON COOPER: I mean, you're doing great right now, but...

DONALD TRUMP: I'm doing great, but -- but it's not that I wouldn't. It's not -- it's a phenomenal position. I -- you know, and I think it's a very powerful position.

It's not for me. I love what I'm doing. I would rather be doing this.

(CROSSTALK)

I have buildings all over the world.

I'm not doing this to be president. I'm doing this to make America great again.

ANDERSON COOPER: Do you rule out the idea of running as an independent party candidate or third-party candidate if for some reason you don't get the GOP nomination?

DONALD TRUMP: Everybody asks me to do it. I have had so many people saying, would you run as an independent? Would you run as a third party candidate? And I think, you know, they see the kind of votes, I'd get a lot of votes.

The best way of defeating the Democrats, and probably Hillary, I think it's going to be Hillary, to run as a Republican. If I do the third party thing it would be I think very bad for the Republicans. I think it would be very bad in terms of beating the Democrats. And we have to win.

DONALD TRUMP: Beautiful. So, so nice.

(APPLAUSE)

So nice. So they say we set a record tonight.

(APPLAUSE)

Now, I am going to make the people outside angry, but they love me and I love them. We have over 1,000 people outside. We have hundreds in the second auditorium, but you people got the good real estate, right? You got the good real estate.

(APPLAUSE)

So this has been an amazing period of time. I know it is very early, but the polls have been through the roof, every one of them.

(APPLAUSE)

Because -- and I don't know if it's for me or if it's for the message or a combination of both but, you know, I brought back a term that hasn't been used in a long time. It's called the silent majority. There's a tremendous silent majority...

(APPLAUSE)

... that politicians have taken advantage of. I mean they have taken advantage of the people of this country long enough. They are largely incompetent except when it comes to getting reelected. That is what they do. And look, who knows them better than me? I have contributed to everybody. And who knows them better than me? They are great at one thing, don't make any make waves, get reelected, serve it out, then get reelected again. That's it all the time. I have been watching it for so many years, and I personally am sick and tired of it.

(APPLAUSE)

So backstage, I met some of the vets, the greatest people we have in this country.

(APPLAUSE)

And they have been mistreated. They have been treated like third-class citizens. And it's going to stop. It's going to stop.

(APPLAUSE)

You look at the senators and the congressman. They ride around. They're like kings. They think, "Great. Oh, isn't it great?" They come. They make speeches. Nothing ever happens. So two weeks ago on Wednesday, they had the longest waits in reception rooms and reception areas in the history of the veterans administration, people waiting three days, four days, five days to see a doctor -- to see a doctor. So we are going to straighten that. That's called management. It's called management. That is all it is.

(APPLAUSE)

The military is going to be so strong in this country.

(APPLAUSE)

That nobody is going to mess around with the United States, that I can tell you -- that I can tell you. Nobody.

(APPLAUSE)

You know, over the last few weeks, Jeb Bush...

(BOOING)

... in favor of common core, weak on immigration, not good on military, can you believe he thought the Iraq war was a good thing? I mean, yeah, you could make a mistake. I was against it for a long time. I'm the most militaristic person in this room but you have to know when to use it. You have to know when to use it. Think about it.

(APPLAUSE)

We spent $2 trillion in Iraq. China is taking a lot of the oil, just so you understand. ISIS may have it and Iran may have it, but China is taking out a lot of the oil. Can you imagine? We spent -- we never do anything right with China. We spent $2 trillion. Thousands of lives of great people, mostly young, beautiful people, wounded warriors, who I love all over the place, not treated properly by the way.

(APPLAUSE)

And we have nothing. And Iran is taking over Iraq. And the parts that they want to give up, they're giving oil to ISIS. So ISIS has the oil. And you remember when I said you shouldn't go in. And in fact, just check it, Reuters wrote an article, big article, in 2004 that, "Trump, don't go in because you're going to ruin the balance."

Iran and Iraq, they were the same. They were twins. They have wars for years -- wars, boom. One goes this way, one goes that way. One -- and I said if you take out one, the other one is going to take over. Well, we took out one and look at the mess we have. We destabilized the Middle East and it is a mess.

(APPLAUSE)

And Jeb Bush couldn't -- he didn't know the difference. He couldn't answer a question, was Iraq a good thing or a bad thing? It's all right to say they made a mistake. Finally, after going to his pollster -- who has a fortune too, by the way -- after five days, he said it was a bad thing. OK. So let's accept that that's OK.

Then the other day I'm watching -- yesterday, and he said, "Well, we got Saddam Hussein out, didn't we?" I mean I'm not a fan of Saddam Hussein, but he ran the place, and he had no weapons of mass destruction. And now instead of Saddam Hussein, we have far more brutal. We have ISIS and we will have Iran because they are already making deals. Two weeks I read where the leaders of Iraq are visiting the leaders of Iran. What do we get out of this? What do we get? We have stupid leadership. Now, if you remember -- so I didn't want to in I was right.

(APPLAUSE)

I didn't to want to go in but I was right, but then we were in. And it was bad and there were still were bombings up. But it was bad, but we're in. At some point we have to go out, right? I mean we can't stay there forever. We have to rebuild this country. We have to rebuild our country. You know, we have to.

(APPLAUSE)

Our bridges are falling apart. Our roads are a mess. Our schools, our highways, everything, it's a mess. Our -- and who is better at infrastructure than Trump. OK. OK.

(APPLAUSE)

So, look. At some point we have to get out. They talked about the surge -- the surge. Remember Bush's brother, he said, "The war is over. We've taken over." You know, like there were two days later, it was a disaster. Now, Obama said that with Yemen. He announced Yemen was a total victory. And then like three months later, it was like a disaster. And we don't have Yemen. We don't have anything.

We send over to our allies, if you call them that, they don't even know what they are. There is no word for them, OK? Iraq isn't even a country. Iraq is a bunch of corrupt people that sort of string something together. It is not a country. But we send over to our allies 2,500 Humvees. So when I heard 2,500 I thought it was a typo in the "New York Times". I said, "They mean 25. They mean 2.5. They mean 250, maybe." That's a lot.

So these are 2500 Humvees, armor plated all over. So when the bombs go off you don't lose your legs and you don't lose your life and you don't lose your arms, really great vehicles. One shot is fired and these guys run away and the enemy picks up 2,500. Think of it. Think of it.

So we need the right thinking. And I said -- some people are saying, "What a terrible statement he made, " because when we had to leave -- we had to leave -- you know, you can talk about surging but at some point we have to leave. We can't stay there forever. And if we'd loosen up these rules, we have so much oil under our own feet. We don't need them for those things because of new technologies -- new technology.

(APPLAUSE)

So, we're going to leave. And I say, "Leave but take the oil." Do you remember that? Did anyone ever hear that -- me say that? I'm saying it all the time. I've been saying it for years. Take the oil. And I watch these guys on television, political people, many of them are with the administration and I think they mean well, but they don't have a clue. They say, "Isn't that silly? Mr. Trump says take the oil. Isn't it?" Well, you know where is the oil now? Iran and ISIS. Everybody has it but us. We're the only ones who left the oil.

It's is hard to believe. We need General Douglas MacArthur who I thought he was great. You know, to this date, the highest academic record -- I'm big into school and academics. I love it. I went to the greatest school. You had to be really smart to get into that school, The Wharton School of Finance. But you have to be really smart. And that was before I was Trump, you know. That was before I was Trump. But you have to be really smart. That's like the hardest one but, you know, even then, by the way.

But General Douglas MacArthur to this day was the greatest student in the history of West Point plus he had the look, he had the whole deal. He was a general. I don't see it now so much. I don't want to knock the generals, but I see some of these guys come on. Can we defeat is? I don't think so.

(LAUGHTER)

You know, I don't want to use names but, you know, he is sort of retiring. Then you have General George Patton.

(APPLAUSE)

So do you think General Patton -- when President Obama -- remember not so long ago he said we're going to attack a certain city. And he said, in two weeks we're going to attack this city and we're going to attack from the front.

(LAUGHTER)

And we'll use drones and we're going to use this with -- in the meantime, the enemy is saying, "Ha. Ding ding." And it was brutal. It turned out to be a brutal situation. I said, you know, that's great. That is camouflage. What a smart thing he is doing because he's probably going to do the opposite. Well, in two weeks we attacked. We attacked from the -- it was the craziest thing I've ever seen. It was a terrible view, something that should have taken 24 hours was like months. And I said I wonder what General MacArthur and General Patton -- just to name two of the great ones -- are doing now in their graves? You know what they're doing? Spinning. They're spinning. They're saying, "I don't believe it. I don't believe it."

So we have such a great country, but we've gone down so far. China yesterday -- I'm big for the world of financial -- and I tell you what, CNN did a poll and I was through the roof on the economy. I was like really high. I had to be exactly accurate because, otherwise, they will have front page joy that Donald Trump gave false. But I mean I was many times number two. I went through the roof in leadership. That's a pretty important subject, right -- leadership. I killed everybody on leadership, right?

(APPLAUSE)

I did great on the military. And I actually think the military would be just as good as the economic for me personally. I think I'd be so good on those. Oh, would I be tough? Oh, these poor people. I would be creating things that nobody would be playing with us. Nobody. Nobody.

(APPLAUSE)

And I don't necessarily mean soldiers. I mean -- we love our soldiers, but I mean, you know, we have weaponry that's obsolete. We have nuclear weapons. Can you believe, 60 minutes does a show and the show -- the whole show was how bad a condition our nuclear weapons are in. Did anybody see that show? I would say, can you write? I said even if it's true, can you believe we're putting this for the world to see, for Putin to see? By the way, two weeks after that show, Putin said, "They better not mess with us. We have nuclear weapons. Can you imagine Putin said it from Russia?

(LAUGHTER)

And the reason they did that is the President wanted the press to see how weak our nuclear capabilities. Remember the telephones? They don't work. They were 40 years old and they have wires and the wires were rotting. And in order to work the telephones where our silos are and the silos were all rusty and rotting and the kids said -- nice kids -- they said, "We don't know if it works." Oh, great.

(LAUGHTER)

And they're screaming over the phone because the wires are so damaged and so old and this is our nuclear. Now, assuming that's true, which it is, who the hell would show that to the enemy? And the reason he gave is because he wants some funding to get them fixed up. Oh, that's great.

So we have to get smart people, tough people, cunning people. China, you probably read -- some of you aren't into this, but basically yesterday they did the largest devaluation in the history of China. Now, they think the history, but they say only the last two decades. Oh, OK. Now, I feel much better. Some people said in history, but they actually brought it down to two decades, in other words, 20 years. OK. OK. What that means is you hear the sucking sound. You know what the sucking sound is?

UNIDENTIFIED: Jobs.

DONALD TRUMP: That means jobs. That means money. That means all of this coming out. They did a number on us. And I said when they did the last one, which wasn't long ago, like six, seven months ago, but it was a much more modest devaluation, I said I can't believe Obama is allowing this to happen. And we have all the cards. I just told the press it's the greatest theft in the history of the United States what China has done to us. We have rebuilt China. Our money has rebuilt China.

(APPLAUSE)

You go over to China there bridges are being built all over the place. I mean bridges that make the George Washington Bridge and other bridges look small. And I am not using the George Washington Bridge for political purposes, OK? Please.

(LAUGHTER)

Because I would do that. But it makes like the George -- like small time. They're building massive bridges, massive highways, massive roads. I went over -- I was in Dubai. Great place. They have an airport, it's like magic. It's the most incredible thing you have ever seen. You go to Qatar. You go to places in China, many cities in China. You go to all these places. And then we go home and we land at LaGuardia.

(LAUGHTER)

Or we land at Kennedy where they have hangers that are falling down. They're rotting and rusting. And there are potholes in the runways. No, it is such a shock. You know, we don't realize it. You know, we go to Kennedy. We go to Florida. We go whatever. And we don't -- you know, after a while you get used to things. You know what I mean? Like when your house gets dirty or when it needs a paint job you'll say it looks OK, right?

(LAUGHTER)

But these airlines are so bad -- thank you -- these airlines, it's so sad. It's so sad. Then you look at the age of our infrastructure. You look at all of the different things, even the airlines, the airplanes. I was asked by -- because they were actually a tenant of mine, Qatar, which they call Qatar. I've always said Qatar. They asked me why I call it Qatar. But I said people -- in this country they like Qatar better, right? I like Qatar. I wouldn't say Qatar, but I like Qatar. I mean they're very nice people. And they asked me to go to a dinner. And I said, "I can't." And they said, "We'll pay you a lot of money." As rich as I am, I mean it was a lot of money to have a dinner like -- you know, like a tremendous amount of money. So I said, "I'll go."

(LAUGHTER)

That's true. No. You have to understand you can be really rich, but if you're going to get hundreds of thousands of dollars to have a dinner two blocks from your house and you don't do it, it's time to retire. Do we agree? Do we agree?

(APPLAUSE)

So anyway -- so I went and it was so amazing. And I said to the head man of the airline, what is the average age of your planes? And he said like, "Oh, about a year and a half -- a year and a half." And then they show charts with the average age of like some of our airlines, you know, 32 years, 15 years, 28 years, and you see it. And then I said, how do you finance your planes? And he looked at me like, finance? We don't finance. We pay cash.

Saudi Arabia -- and it was very impressed. I mean I was impressed. It wasn't a question. And then when I went to Qatar, I went into an airline terminal that was the most beautiful terminal I have ever seen ever, most magnificent. They had lounges. They had spas. They had spas. Before you get on the plane, you can get a massage. I'm not into that though. I don't like people touching me. It's true. It's true.

(LAUGHTER)

It's true actually. But they have these magnificent spas, everything. And I said to the head man who was taking me for a tour, I said, "This is the most beautiful airline terminal I've ever seen." It was massive. He goes, "No. No. No, Donald. This is temporary. Our new one is being built over there." And he pointed and there must have been 40 cranes, the longest, most beautiful thing you've ever seen. This was a tear down. And I said, "Oh, we're doing it wrong."

Saudi Arabia -- and I have great relationships with Saudi Arabia, as I do with Mexico, as I do with everybody. You know, they all buy apartments from me. They pay millions and millions of dollars. Am I supposed to dislike them? I love them. China, I sell apartments for $50 million, $30 million, $25 million, $18 million, some of the cheap ones like $10 million. OK. Those are the cheap ones. I don't even bother to sign those contracts because -- but I get it from Saudi Arabia. I get it from Japan. I get it from everybody. I love these people.

The problem is Mexico -- I love the Mexican people. They have tremendous spirit -- tremendous spirit. You know, when I opened -- as Rush Limbaugh said, who is a great guy, "Trump has taken more incoming that any human being I've ever seen." And it was only because the press totally changed my statement. They used half a sentence. They use a statement from here. It turned out I was right because I was talking about illegal immigration and it turned out that I was right with all of the problems that are happening.

But when you look at Saudi Arabia, when you look at Mexico -- by the way, Mexico is becoming the new China. They are taking over. Did you know that Nabisco -- Nabisco -- did you see it yesterday? Nabisco is closing a factory in Chicago and they're moving to Mexico this big factory and taking many jobs, particularly about 1,200 jobs are going to be lost in Chicago.

(BOOING)

No more Oreos. They make Oreos out there, right? No more Oreos. I don't like Oreos anymore. But no, they announced that they're doing other things and they're moving to Mexico and it's great. I mean, look, Mexico, if you can get away with it, it's great. I have such respect for the leaders of Mexico and their negotiators. So I don't dislike them. The biggest bank in the world is a bank and tenant in my building -- one of my buildings. It's an incredible bank. It's the largest bank. Citibank is like a tiny subsidiary compared to this one in size. And I never have to worry about the rent, right?

But -- so I love these people, apartments this -- with Mexico, I've hired, as an example, thousands -- over the years, thousands of people have worked for me from Mexico and from lots of other places. They're incredible people. But the problem is their leaders are smarter and sharper and more cunning than our leaders. They're much more cunning. The word cunning is very important because it's like -- it's like a (INAUDIBLE). You know, they know what's going on. And they are ripping us left and right, all of these countries. Frankly, I mean I could mention a hundred, every -- we don't make good deals anymore.

So one of our great deal makers, you probably heard of him, Carl Icahn, right? Good, smart guy, right? So I had dinner with him the other night. I said, "Carl, if I do this -- and I'm really doing well. I mean, you know, hey, are we leading in every poll -- every single poll.

(APPLAUSE)

And it's the talk of politics. I mean it's really become the talk of politics. It's like a great honor. But we got to get there. You know, I don't want to talk about it. I want to get there. I was called by one of the biggest journalists in the world the other day.

He said, "Mr. Trump, could I ask you a question?" "What?" "How does it feel? How does what feel?" I said, "How does what feel?" He said, "You have done something that nobody else has ever done. You've taken over television. You've taken over the airwaves. It's the summer of Trump " You know they're calling it the Summer of Trump.

(APPLAUSE)

No. OK. And I said -- and this is a highly respected guy, an amazing guy. And I said I haven't done anything because I haven't won. It starts with one in the primaries than going on and winning. I mean if this all happens and I don't win -- it starts with winning the primers, getting the nomination and then going on and winning. I consider it a total waste of time. He said you are wrong. You have done a great thing. Trust me. I won't be happy, OK? I won't be happy.

(APPLAUSE)

But we're all doing well. Think of this. So if you look at Saudi Arabia, they make a billion dollars a day -- a billion dollars a day. We're talking about a billion dollars a day, OK? And when they have a problem, we send over our ships. We send over our planes. And I don't mind doing it but they could help us out, folks. They could help. They got nothing but money. They are wonderful. They're wonderful. I love they're investing in the United States. I love they're investing in New York in buying properties. They could help us. We are a debtor nation. We owe $19 trillion. We have massive unfunded liabilities. We are a nation that is in serious trouble and it is going up rapidly and Obamacare is a disaster. It's a catastrophe.

(APPLAUSE)

It's got to be repealed and replaced. It's got to be. First of all, your premiums. I don't even have to see it. Your premiums have gone way up. Your deductibles are through the roof, unless you're hit by a tractor, right? It's true. And the reason I mention tractor, I'll tell you. So Japan now has a great leader, Shinzo Abe. He's a killer.

Our negotiator is Carolyn Kennedy who got the job by going into the White House and saying, "I have nothing to do." This was on television. They said, how did you get the job. And she is a nice president. You know I say she is nice? Because my daughter, Ivanka, likes her. My daughter is so great. She is just a great person. My daughter likes her. She said, "Daddy, she's such a nice person." I don't want a nice. I want a killer. We're tired of the nice people.

Somebody said it to me, "Mr. Trump, I don't know a woman who is a fan of mine." She said, "I don't know if you have the personality to get elected because you're not a nice person." I said, "Actually, I am a nice person. I love helping people. You watch. You watch. I will help on women's health issues more than anybody including on the Democratic side, women's health issues. You watch. You watch.

Bush the other day didn't want to fund them. He said I don't want to fund women's health issues. He didn't want to fund. That's worse than Romney's 47 percent, which probably caused them the election along with other things like you forgot to campaign for about three weeks at the end, OK?" That didn't help. Forgot to go on television for about three weeks.

But we have to do something and we have to do it fast. And if we don't do it fast, we're not going to have a country. Now, speaking of that -- speaking of that, you know, it's funning I got a great review on the speech the other night. They say his only problem is he speaks through his applause. You know why? I don't have time to wait for the applause? I want to just do it. It's true.

The guy gave me like this great review. He said he is a great speaker. He does it beautiful. He's a -- you know, he's not scripted, which is good. Supposing I was reading all this stuff, you know, with the teleprompter, I actually said if you're running for president, you should not be allowed to use a teleprompter. No, it's true. It's true.

(APPLAUSE)

It's so easy. No. you walk up -- yeah. You walk...

(LAUGHTER)

Ladies and gentlemen, hello.

(LAUGHTER)

No. No.

(APPLAUSE)

You shouldn't be allowed because you don't know what you're going to get. Look what happened with Obama who is a teleprompter guy. No, it's true. But...

UNIDENTIFIED: (OFF-MIKE) president.

DONALD TRUMP: Ha?

UNIDENTIFIED: I don't want a scripted president.

DONALD TRUMP: You bet. You're right. You don't want a scripted president.

(APPLAUSE)

And you don't want a politically correct president because it takes too much law. It takes too much time.

(APPLAUSE)

It is true. It is true. You don't want this political correctness stuff. Now, I hear there is a certain college -- I won't say it's in your state -- but they don't want you to differentiate between a man and a woman. You heard about this one, right? If that would ever pass, I'm gone. That's too much. But the things that are happening are so crazy.

And you know, you talk about political -- you probably heard about the little debate we just had recently. If I were politically correct during that debate I would have gotten clobbered. And instead, we won the debate. And you know, after the debate, all the poll numbers went up. But boy, was that hell of a time? Was that incredible? Was that incredible?

(APPLAUSE)

So that debate -- that debate has always had like 2 million, 3 million people. You know, the first debate, bam, bam, bam, every four years. There are 24 million people. And probably going to go up much higher than that when the final numbers come in. So do you think they were there for Jeb Bush or Rand Paul? Rand, I've had you up to hear.

(APPLAUSE)

It is funny though because Rand Paul -- sit down -- I'll ask you a question. Go ahead. Sit down. Do really think I want to say ask you a question? That is OK. He's a good guy. I have seen his face before. He's been at every rally. And what am I going to do? Not take his question? I'll take your question in a minute. One sec -- no. No. Wait.

So Rand Paul has been hitting me because he's like -- his polls are like going down. He is weak on military. Can you imagine today being weak on the military? You know what? Even Dobbs are strong. I have a friend -- I mean this friend didn't want to even talk about military. Now, he has become worse than me. I mean he has become like a total -- like this total incredible Hulk, and that's good.

So Rand Paul is weak on the military. He is weak on immigration. He is weak on everything. He's got no numbers. So all of a sudden I see him -- you know, he called me up. He said, "I'd love to -- this was like a year ago. He wants to play a round of golf with me. I said, "Oh, no. don't tell me." So I'm actually a good golfer. I killed him, OK? I killed him. If I didn't, I wouldn't say it, but I killed him.

But more importantly after that, he said, "Do you think you could do me a favor?" "What?" Could you contribute to my eye center?" I said, "You know what? What do they do? Bam, bam, bam." I said, yes, I will. I gave him a lot of money. I'm not -- I don't want anything. I just gave him a lot of money. Then all of a sudden I see him chirping on the stage. He's like chirping. I said, "Who is that over there, that person?" Who is that he?" And now, he is going around, you know, saying like bad things, whatever, you know.

And the beauty is this, nobody ever attacked me like Senator Lindsey Graham -- I mean what he said and he went from 1 percent to nothing.

(APPLAUSE)

It is true. Nobody ever attacked me. Nobody Like Perry (oh) of Texas, who by the way did a lousy job at the border. I mean he's talking about the border. The guy was governor and he keeps talking about the border. I said, "You're the governor of Texas. Why didn't you fix it?" The new governor is doing much better than him, but we won't say that, OK -- because he's actually a nice man. And he didn't like it when I said you have to pass an IQ test to come on the stage. He said -- no. He said to me, Donald Trump is keeping a senator -- by the way, a failed senator off the stage.

I said, "Wait a minute. I went to the best schools, great student, went out, made a fortune. Did The Apprentice -- one of the most successful shows on television ever. NBC renewed it. I said I'm doing it. NBC comes up renewed -- the biggest people in NBC came to my office four months ago, "Please do it. Please. Please." I said I'm not doing that. I'm going to make this country great again. I'm going to run for president. We're going to make the country great.

(APPLAUSE)

I wrote many bestsellers including -- many best sellers including, "Trump, the Art of the Deal, " which was about the number one selling business book of all time. There he is. He's got it. I said the other night my second favorite book. Did you know what I said is my first favorite book? The Bible.

(APPLAUSE)

That's true. It's the same thing. And I didn't ask him to stand up. Actually, I got my biggest hand the other night when I said that. I said my favorite book is the Bible. My second favorite book is "The Art of the Deal, " but it is not even close to the Bible, (INAUDIBLE).

But anyway -- so these people, they went down. So, now I have -- now, I have -- I have a new guy coming. It's Rand Paul and that's OK. And actually Carly was a little nasty to me. Be careful, Carly. Be careful. But I cannot say anything to her because she was a woman and I do not want to be accused of being tough on a woman. I cannot do that, right? Can I do that? Women, am I allowed to fight back? Am I allowed?

(LAUGHING)

She has been nasty to me. So I promised that I would not say -- and I said to myself. I promised I would not say that she ran Hewlett-Packard into the ground. I said I will not say that her stock value tanked, that laid off tens of thousands of people, and she got viciously fired. I said I will not say that. And that she then went out and ran against Barbara Boxer for the United States Senate in California and it's a race that should have been won and she lost in the landslide. And I said, I will not say that, OK? All right? So I am not going to say it.

So our country has tremendous potential. We have to take back our jobs from China and all of the other people. We have to renegotiate our trade deals by getting people like Carl Icahn and Henry Kravis and our great deal -- we have the greatest dealmakers in the world. Carl is very busy. I called him. He said, "You're doing great. You're doing great." He's a tough guy. "You're doing great. Every poll, you are doing amazing." I said, "Carl, do me a favor? Just relax. I want to do this."

If I win, you take China. I'll get somebody else to take this one. I'll get some -- we will have our best. And these people -- Carl I think is a nice guy. But some of them are not nice. Some are horrible human beings, OK? But they are the greatest in the world. Do we want nice people or do we want these horrible human beings negotiating? Horrible. I want horrible. I want the horrible ones. We will make great trade deals. We will save Social Security without cuts. We will...

(APPLAUSE)

We will come up with health care plans that will be phenomenal -- phenomenal that will be less expensive. We have to get rid of the little artificial circles. I call them the insurance company circles. You know, what I mean. You're in the business. We have to get rid of the artificial circles wrapping around the states all paid for by your local insurance companies because the have monopolies.

I have a huge company. And if I'm in New York, I get like no bids. I get one bid. OK? I go to New Jersey, where I have a lot of stuff, I go to California, where I have a lot of stuff. I go to Florida, there are no bids because they have monopoly in their little states. So, they would rather have monopoly than be able to negotiate all over the country. In other words they'd rather have New York sewed up than have competition where they have to actually go and work for their money. That's over. That's over. That's over.

(APPLAUSE)

And you have phenomenal plans you'll have for much less money. The insurance companies will not be happy, but see, they don't give me money. They give to Jeb and they give to Hillary and they give to everybody. I don't want their money. I was called today by the biggest lobbyist and -- who I have used. It's great. You can do anything. He said, "Donald, I'd love to make a major contribution to your campaign." I said, "I don't want your money." "No. No. No. You don't understand."

It was like he never heard this before. He said, I want to really, you know, give $4 million or $5 million if it's OK. You're leading in all the polls." You know, they have to protect -- you know, if Trump wins, they got to protect themselves, right? I said, "You know, you're a friend of mine. You're a good guy. I don't want your money." Because what he's going to do is -- if I win and when one of his companies has a problem, I'm going to do what's right for the people of the country.

(APPLAUSE)

I'm not going to do what is right for him and his people. So you have the special interest people and you have all of these lobbyist and you have the donors. And I will tell you nobody is going to control us. We are going to work this together and we're going to make it so strong and so great.

I used the concept of the Ford plant built in Mexico. It shouldn't be built there. We wanted built in Michigan. We want it built in -- we want it built in New Hampshire. We wanted built in Iowa. How does it help us? You go to the great business schools and you do really well and then you come home and you say, well, let's figure this out. They're going to spend $2.5 billion building a plant in Mexico. They're going to make cars, trucks and parts and they're going to ship it back to the United States. How does that help us? And we get no tax. We get no tax.

So, when Jeb becomes president, if that ever happens, or when Hillary, if that ever happens, or when...

(CROWD BOOING)

.... Hey -- hey, it can happen, folks. I hate to tell you. I think it's unlikely. I think it's unlikely. But if Jeb became president, when they say, "Mr. President, it's very bad that Ford is building in Mexico." "Oh, OK, we will do something. Let me go to sleep first. We will do something -- we'll do something about it." As soon as he says we'll do something, hey he's not stupid.

The lobbyists will call him. They gave him some of this $114 million and the donors in the special interest. And so wait a minute, we have stock in Ford. We want Ford to do what they want to do. You have the -- and the lobbyists will go up to him and say, "Mr. President, you can't do this. These people gave you $2.5 million." "Oh, they did. That's right. I can't do it." And they'll build happily and they'll have a nice plant and we'll lose thousands of jobs and, you know, terrible.

Now, what I'd say is different. They will call me, too, but I wouldn't even take their call, but I might take them because some of them were actually nice guy. So, I take them say, no. I'll start the conversation, no. And I wouldn't use color anybody in this because, you know, by the way, I hope the press calls Carl Icahn because he feels very strongly about this, and he wants to do it. He's so anxious to do it. He's got -- he's wealthy as I think -- they all want to do it.

You know, a guy like -- I like Carl Icahn. He's worth many billions of dollars. He wants to do it. It's more important to him than -- he doesn't need another deal. I said Carl, "How many deals can you do?" Just make the -- the great deals to this country. That's the great deal. We got to make this country rich. And then we got to make it great.

(APPLAUSE)

And I've said the same thing to others. But OK, so they come up to Trump, and I wouldn't call any of these guys because this is too easy, too easy. So, they head of Ford calls being up and he says, "Mr. President, we really want to build this plan to Mexico." And said, "Well, congratulations, but you're not going to do it." Well, we're going to go forward. That's OK.

Then we're going to judge you with 35 percent tax on every car and truck and parts that comes into our country.

(APPLAUSE)

Every single one, 35 percent. He says, "You cannot do that." I said, "Trust me. I can do it. Trust me." And what happens is probably they fold before 5 o'clock. It could be they'll play tough and to wait until the next day. I say they fold before 5 o'clock, and the reason is -- the reason I wouldn't waste the time of the killers I told you about, the great negotiators because this is too easy. This is too easy. This is a couple of phone calls.

So, what happens now is the next day, they'll call up. And they'll say, "Please, Mr. President." "No, I want you building in the United States, and if you do it, that's the way it is." And they will say, "Mr. President, we're building our plant in the United States." It's that simple. It's that simple.

(APPLAUSE)

Who would let -- who would let Nabisco -- Nabisco -- who would let Nabisco go to Mexico? Who would let these car companies -- in Tennessee, they were expecting a great deal with a major foreign car company. It's going to be built in Tennessee. It's all set. It's going to be built in Tennessee. It's going to be a great deal. And all of a sudden the last moment, they announced, they're not going to do it in Tennessee. They're doing it in Mexico. Who would allow that to happen?

UNIDENTIFIED: Obama.

DONALD TRUMP: That -- well, Obama. You're right about that. That's' a very good answer. It won't happen. Believe me. With trump, it won't happen.

(APPLAUSE)

I won't happen. Go ahead. I mean, this guy, I hope these questions worth it. This guy has -- has been standing up for the entire thing when -- I hope this going to be a good question. Go ahead.

UNIDENTIFIED: ... Thirty years, I've had threats on my life, OK. I worked on the time and Fox hasn't touched this. I've been in touch with Kelly, too. And I've been...

DONALD TRUMP: Let's go. Come on. Got to go.

UNIDENTIFIED: All right.

DONALD TRUMP: Got to go.

UNIDENTIFIED: This counter...

DONALD TRUMP: This is going by up host meets this guy.

UNIDENTIFIED: Yeah. There's counterfeit substandard parts and most of the nuclear plants in the United States...

DONALD TRUMP: Counterfeit substandard parts in nuclear plants in the United States. I'm not surprised to hear that. Why? Am I surprised?

UNIDENTIFIED: And some of them have come from China. Now, when I brought...

(CROSSTALK)

DONALD TRUMP: And in airplanes, too, gentleman.

UNIDENTIFIED: ... when I brought this out, the NRC, Nuclear Regulatory Commission, accused me of conspiring to top their -- topple their agency, had me in mass federal court for six years why it was for a short time. Now, right now, you could do something for the State of Massachusetts and New Hampshire. And I just got back from Chattanooga, too. And I spoke to some Marines there that the security hope...

DONALD TRUMP: I love you guys, with this one.

UNIDENTIFIED: Yeah.

DONALD TRUMP: Did I do the right thing in letting them in? By the way, he happens to be right. Look, you don't even have to tell me. I guarantee you they have substandard parts in nuclear and in airplanes, and the -- because they get them from China, and when you get from China, you don't know what the hell you're getting. Go ahead. Finish your question real fast. The security bullet proofs. I want these people happy.

(CROSSTALK)

UNIDENTIFIED: The security bullet -- the security bullet at the Seabrook Nuclear Plant is empty right now and the NRC said, this is not required. OK? Now, I got involved because I'm in the nursing home profession.

DONALD TRUMP: OK. Given, you know, I got to go. I got to go. Thank you for that.

UNIDENTIFIED: Wait a minute.

DONALD TRUMP: No.

UNIDENTIFIED: Let me finish this.

DONALD TRUMP: You know, what I think your question is great. And I can understand. He's talking about basically counterfeit parts just to cut to the chase. We don't have to know that you're in the nursing home business. What are you trying to talk to some of us about joining her home? Come on. Sit down. No. We think it's good. We think your point is good. Yeah, give it to him. Good. I'll read it tonight around 1:00 in the morning instead of sleeping.

All right. It's good. It's good. Go, sit. Come on, come on. Let's go. What a nice guy, right? Nice guy. Hey, he means well. Honestly, he means well. You do.

(APPLAUSE)

Oh, stand up. You stand up. This guy I love. Tell me, how bad are the vets being treated?

UNIDENTIFIED: That you understand. Way worse than we understand.

DONALD TRUMP: Go ahead.

UNIDENTIFIED: We've got over 8,000 veterans a year that cannot get access to care. And it is -- let me put this in context, 8,000 veterans are committing suicide because of the incompetence and the corruption going on in the V.A. System. That's just the ones committing suicide. Let me put this...

DONALD TRUMP: That's tremendous problem.

UNIDENTIFIED: ... right.

DONALD TRUMP: Suicide, we'll get into that.

(CROSSTALK)

UNIDENTIFIED: Just put this in context. That is the equivalent of a World War II Bataan Death March every year.

DONALD TRUMP: Yeah.

UNIDENTIFIED: OK?

DONALD TRUMP: I didn't hear about it so much since -- some stop writing this unbelievable.

(CROSSTALK)

UNIDENTIFIED: Forty-seven thousand veterans total for all kinds of other reasons. No one has been indicted. No one is going to jail. The V.A. OIG has been proven to covering it up that's the OIG head that just lost his job recently. When you're president, can I have your word that you will bring in the FBI and start investigating this V.A. because we need to a clean...

(CROSSTALK)

(APPLAUSE)

DONALD TRUMP: I will do that. It can't be. I will do that.

(APPLAUSE)

Look. It can't be -- great question. It can't be just incompetence. Because it's so bad what's happening to the vets and -- and the V.A. It's so bad that it can't be just incompetence. It's got to be theft and it's got to be a lot more than we're hearing about. So, I would do that. Thank you, man.

(APPLAUSE)

Go ahead. Come on.

UNIDENTIFIED: I have to fight for this because my son is an active duty Gunnery -- Gunnery Sergeant in the United States Marine Corps, and I will not let him walk into this nightmare like I did.

DONALD TRUMP: OK. I love it. I love it. Thank you.

(APPLAUSE)

Go ahead. Let's take it. You want to take it. Who wants to leave? Does anybody want to leave?

UNIDENTIFIED: No.

DONALD TRUMP: No. I have all night. Let's take a couple of questions. Go ahead. Go ahead.

UNIDENTIFIED: Use that fire move down, do you think you can fire some of these federal employees at the V.A.?

DONALD TRUMP: Well, they have to. They got on EPA. They have the EPA.

(APPLAUSE)

How about the EPA? OK? How about our Common Core folks in Washington? How about Common Core in Washington? Do you think you could get rid of a few there? You're right, right. Good question.

Yes, sir. Go ahead. Young guy here. Go ahead.

UNIDENTIFIED: I'm a NASA space technology research fellow at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

DONALD TRUMP: You know, my uncle was a professor at MIT.

(APPLAUSE)

UNIDENTIFIED: So, I'm in a joint program MIT in Harvard Medical School, and I'm actually a graduate of Winnacunnet...

DONALD TRUMP: Pretty smart guy. Go ahead.

(APPLAUSE)

UNIDENTIFIED: When you announced that you're going to run for president, you said that America needs victories again.

DONALD TRUMP: Yes. We have no victories. Do we have victories? Yeah, when do we meet somebody in trade and -- we don't -- we don't meet any guy.

UNIDENTIFIED: So, in my industry -- we have so many victories.

(CROSSTALK)

DONALD TRUMP: We're going to have so many victories pouring out of your heart in case get in years.

(APPLAUSE)

You watch. Go ahead.

UNIDENTIFIED: So, in my industry, one of our biggest victories was putting a man on the moon.

DONALD TRUMP: Yeah.

UNIDENTIFIED: What do you think about putting humans on Mars?

DONALD TRUMP: Honestly, I think it's wonderful. I want to rebuild our infrastructure first. OK? I think it's wonderful.

(APPLAUSE)

Go ahead. Yeah? Go ahead. Get -- wait for that mike. Go ahead. Come on. Let's go with it. Just shout. Go ahead.

UNIDENTIFIED: My name is Brenda Misure. I live in Mabry. I've been a caregiver for nearly 10 years. My husband has younger onset Alzheimer's disease.

DONALD TRUMP: OK.

UNIDENTIFIED: My mother is almost 89 and she has Alzheimer's disease. I'm one 65,000 Alzheimer's caregiver here in the State of New Hampshire.

DONALD TRUMP: Yes. Alzheimer's (INAUDIBLE).

UNIDENTIFIED: And Alzheimer's receives $600 million from NIH, while we're spending $153 billion in Medicare and Medicaid...

(CROSSTALK)

DONALD TRUMP: Well, I would...

(CROSSTALK)

UNIDENTIFIED: ... with Alzheimer's. So, my question to you is what will you do to ensure that this devastating disease is a top priority?

DONALD TRUMP: It's total top priority for me. I have so many friends whose family is devastated by Alzheimer's. So, it's -- believe me, it's a total priority. That's something that we should be working on and we can get an answer. There are some answers. They've made less progress than we had hope as you know. But there's some answers.

Yes, ma 'am. Yes?

UNIDENTIFIED: I think we have some -- I think these disorders from the discussion (INAUDIBLE). I wondered you might speak from the heart and tell us what specifically endears New Hampshire to you?

DONALD TRUMP: The people. I mean, honestly, I've had such a great response. So, I love the question.

(APPLAUSE)

Somebody, one of my friends -- thank you. One of my friends was asking me what was it's like when you got -- because I've been here a lot. And you know, we've -- we've done so many town halls and so many different meetings, and now we're really -- we're having so many people we need -- the bigger auditoriums which worked out well.

And now, you know, I'm going to go see the other auditorium where they didn't have the great real estate, right? And I'm going to see the people outside that are waiting to see us. But -- but...

(APPLAUSE)

... but the people of New Hampshire are amazing. They like the people that built this country. They work hard, you know, I say, they are smart, they are industrious, and they love this country. They want to see it happen. They are great people. And...

(APPLAUSE)

... I was so honored, you know, because recently everybody said that a Walker would win Iowa, right? And Bush, who's, you know, falling like a stone, because he's sort of like, you know, I don't know, Kennebunkport? I -- I -- tell me is that really so. Here, Scott that's from a different planet, right?

I don't get it. But -- but they said Bush, well he's being down big. And Walker, you have to remember Walker grew up a little in Iowa, became the governor of the adjoining state but what people don't know is they have tremendous massive deficits. They have very, very poor employment, new jobs. They have a lot of dissension. A lot of problems in Wisconsin which is a state I love. But they have a lot of problems with their education. They're having a lot of problems.

And with their debt, they're putting tremendous amounts of debt. So, it sort of funny, I was very nice to Walker. He came up to my room. I gave him money for his campaign. I give to everybody. Anybody wants to run, I give, you know, I give a lot of money to people, right? So, I gave him money. He came up to see me about six month ago. They gave me a plaque. He gave me a plaque. You need some money?

There, but he gave me a plaque. I know he's very nice. And then I was very nice to him because I can't be mean to somebody that doesn't like, you know, there are couple of guys running that have been so nice to me. And I can't say that about, I want to. And then one of his underlings said something sort of nasty about me. I said, "Oh, finally I can talk about Wisconsin. It was so good." And he plunged in Iowa and I'm leading Iowa big. And we're leading right and we're leading New Hampshire big.

(APPLAUSE)

Then you know, we are leading Nevada big. And what I loved about Nevada, they did a second part at the poll and the second part of the poll, you saw it. It came out last week. Everybody was really shock. I wasn't because I'm going to bring jobs back into this country. I'm leading all candidates in the Hispanic vote. Everybody was surprised. Say, why are you surprised?

I employed thousands and thousands of Hispanics. They are amazing people but people were surprised to see that. So, I'm leading North Carolina, we're leading by massive numbers. South Carolina, we're leading by massive numbers. We're leading everywhere. And a poll came out 32 percent nationwide. Another one 24 percent Fox. CNN came out, it was a massive 24 percent poll.

We're leading because people are tired of what's happening to our country. They are tired of being ripped off by everybody in the world.

(APPLAUSE)

They are tired of it. You know...

(APPLAUSE)

... the American dream, we talked about it, and I used the expression a lot -- the American dream and we have -- look at all those cameras blazing back there. This is live all over the place. On Fox, on CNN. It's live. I get up to make speech and I speak from the heart. I really do. I don't have -- look, there's nothing.

(APPLAUSE)

I speak from the heart. But...

(APPLAUSE)

.... but a big portion, not all of it, but a big portion of the media, the political media, particularly so dishonest. They're really dishonest people, and you probably heard me say -- I always say I like to say, the American dream is dead, but I'm going to make it bigger and better and stronger than ever before, OK?

(APPLAUSE)

I say it all the time. The American dream is dead, but I'm going to make it bigger, better, stronger than ever. OK. So, I say it all the time. So, I go home a month ago, and my wife saw me speaking on television, and she said, "Darling, that was such a horrible thing you said. It was so nasty." I said, "What did I say?" "You said the American dream is dead." I said, "No. I said it's dead, but we're going to make it great." Right?

So, I turn on television, people. I turn on television and I see it, and it says, the American dream is dead, bomb, period. I said, that's terrible. No. It's so dishonest. But the fact is, a lot of people think it is dead. And it's got a lot of problems. There's no question about it. But we are going to make our country great again. We are going to do things with our country...

(APPLAUSE)

... that are going to be so good and so smart and so spectacular. And we going to be respected by the world, again, and not laughed at like we're all a bunch of stupid people being led by incompetent politicians. It's not going to go on any longer. We're not going to take it any longer. We're going to make America great, again.

Thank you, and I love you, people. I love you, people. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you, thank you. Give me that. Thank you. Thank you.

(BACKGROUND MUSIC PLAYING)

Thank you.

DONALD TRUMP: I will. I will.

UNIDENTIFIED: Thank you.

DONALD TRUMP: Thank you.

DONALD TRUMP: You will be proud of your leaders once again. Now, WikiLeaks shows us that John Podesta said Hillary Clinton has bad instincts. Bernie Sanders said she has bad judgment. What are we doing folks? These people work with her. What are we doing? One of her close allies said she doesn't seem to know what planet we're all living in. This is her allies saying this. The emails also show her staff saying she has no core. She has no core. That's because she just does whatever her donors and special interests want her to do.

According to the highly respected Pew, there are 24 million voter registrations in the United States that are either invalid or significantly inaccurate. A lot, right. 24 million. Lot. There are 1.8 million dead people that are registered right now to vote. And folks, folks, some of them vote. I wonder why. I wonder how that happened. They woke up from the dead and they went and voted. There are 2.8 million people that are registered in more than one state. So we'll vote here. Let's ride down the road. Let's vote... Maybe they'll vote for Trump. I may be hurting myself. You're right. You're right, maybe they're gonna vote for Trump. All right, let's forget that. It's OK for them to do it. 14 percent of non-citizens are registered to vote.

The system is also rigged by the media. WikiLeaks shows the media conspiring and colluding directly with the Clinton Campaign. Emails even show the Clintons boasting gleefully about very friendly and malleable reporters.

But to be a rich nation we must also be a safe nation. National security begins at the border. Speaking in secret to a foreign bank, Hillary Clinton said her dream is for totally open trade, there go your jobs, and open borders, there goes your country. There goes your country. WikiLeaks. WikiLeaks.

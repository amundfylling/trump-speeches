BILL O'REILLY: Now for the top story tonight, another big weekend for Donald Trump. He's got a new book out, "Crippled America: How to Make America Great Again." Also he's hosting "Saturday Night Live." Ratings are likely to be historic. I spoke with him this morning.

So you pounded Carson on that bio thing with CNN. But if the media's trying to dig up stuff on you too. Can't you guys....

DONALD TRUMP: Well... I know, well, I know. They've been, they've been doing it for 25 years.

BILL O'REILLY: You guys should all... Yeh, you guys should all stick together on this little small ball dopey stuff.

DONALD TRUMP: Yeh, but I've been around a long time, they've been doing it to me for a long time. I'm pretty well vetted, I think. I mean maybe they'll find something I didn't know about.

BILL O'REILLY: They'll try, believe me.

DONALD TRUMP: Oh, they'll try, believe me.

BILL O'REILLY: Yeh.

DONALD TRUMP: And that's fine, that's fine. But, you know, if you think about what Carson's saying, he hit his mother over the head with a hammer...

BILL O'REILLY: No, he hit a friend. He almost did, but whatever....

DONALD TRUMP: He hit a friend in the face with a lock, he tried to kill somebody with a knife, and he said he suffers from pathological disease, OK? When you suffer from pathological disease, you're not really getting better unless you start taking lots of pills and things.

BILL O'REILLY: A kid, he was a kid.

DONALD TRUMP: Wellll..

BILL O'REILLY: You know, and he writes in the (contest)...

DONALD TRUMP: And then he went into a bathroom and all of a sudden he found religion.

BILL O'REILLY: He's a kid, right. And, and it, it's one of these stories where...

DONALD TRUMP: I'm surprised you're so gullible. I've never seen you like this.

BILL O'REILLY: It's not a matter of being gullible. I said quite clearly I have no blanking idea what happened, OK?

DONALD TRUMP: You know what's amazing to me, Bill? Here's a guy says the mother with a, a, you know, hit her with a hammer, all of these things...

BILL O'REILLY: But it doesn't matter. Don't you get that?

DONALD TRUMP: No, no. But he's trying to prove that he did it in order to have credibility. Who would want to prove this? I think, you know, I actually...

BILL O'REILLY: He's 13 or 12 when he did it. He's a little kid. And he's -- the story is...

DONALD TRUMP: I never, I never hit my mother over the head. (INAUDIBLE) And you didn't either.

BILL O'REILLY: The story is redemption, that's what he's trying to get across.

DONALD TRUMP: No.

BILL O'REILLY: But be that as it may, the bigger story is...

DONALD TRUMP: Did you ever hit your mother?

BILL O'REILLY: No. Of course not.

DONALD TRUMP: I don't think so. And you didn't write that you hit her?

BILL O'REILLY: No.

DONALD TRUMP: There's something every strange here, something very strange is going on.

BILL O'REILLY: My point is that you and Carson, and every other Republican, when this kind of stuff happens, unsubstantiated, you should say, hey, it's small ball, we've got bigger things to deal with.

DONALD TRUMP: Well, I don't think it's small ball if you have somebody that admits that he suffers from pathological disease.

BILL O'REILLY: When he was 13!

DONALD TRUMP: I don't care. You don't get better, you don't get better. You know what makes you better? Pills make you better.

BILL O'REILLY: OK. So now you're Dr. Phil? Come on.

DONALD TRUMP: No, no. You don't get better. I mean you're not going to get better.

BILL O'REILLY: All right. Enough.

DONALD TRUMP: If it's in your stream, it's in your stream, Bill. I mean...

BILL O'REILLY: Enough, enough, enough.

DONALD TRUMP: You know...

BILL O'REILLY: ISIS.

DONALD TRUMP: ...they talk about temperament. Do you think that's the right temperament to be President?

BILL O'REILLY: Look, he's...

DONALD TRUMP: I don't think so.

BILL O'REILLY: Everybody changes when their kids to adults. Now let's get to something serious. It looks like ISIS blew that plane up.

DONALD TRUMP: Bill, that's serious.

BILL O'REILLY: OK, not to me. It looks like ISIS blew that plane up in Egypt. The Russian plane.

DONALD TRUMP: It looked like that to me, yes.

BILL O'REILLY: Yeh. Well, now we have data that's pretty much confirming it. President Obama sends fifty, five zero, Special Forces to Syria to help in the fight against ISIS.

DONALD TRUMP: (INAUDIBLE).

BILL O'REILLY: OK, so.

DONALD TRUMP: And he announces it. By announcing it (INAUDIBLE) danger.

BILL O'REILLY: You're, you're President Trump...

DONALD TRUMP: Right.

BILL O'REILLY: All right?

DONALD TRUMP: Yeh.

BILL O'REILLY: Now we have ISIS blowing airlines out of the sky. What do you do?

DONALD TRUMP: Well, first of all I'm very happy that Russia's bombing the hell out of them. And it was a Russian plane. There's no love lost there. So Russia, having somebody else working that is fine with me, unlike some people, they want to do it themselves. If Russia wants to do it, I think that's terrific. I would go after them...

BILL O'REILLY: So you want to subcontract ISIS out?

DONALD TRUMP: I would go after them so hard and so fast, and one of the things all of a sudden I hear other candidates saying what I've been saying for two years, for three years. Number one, we should have never been in Iraq, but we went there. Big mistake. The way we got out was wrong. I said to take the oil. With ISIS, they're making a fortune on oil. Bomb the hell out of the oil. You bomb the hell out of the oil.

BILL O'REILLY: You want to blow up the Iraqi oil fields...

DONALD TRUMP: Listen, everybody -- no, the ISIS, the stuff that ISIS (INAUDIBLE).

BILL O'REILLY: But, see, that's in Iraq, all right?

DONALD TRUMP: Excuse me, I don't care where it is. Excuse me, excuse me.

BILL O'REILLY: You have to bomb the Iraqi oil fields.

DONALD TRUMP: I don't care where it is. What's Iraq? Iraq is a bunch of thieves that are running the government, sort of.

BILL O'REILLY: All right, OK. But let's deal with ISIS now and Syria.

DONALD TRUMP: Yeh, but Bill, you have to take away the money -- I'm dealing with ISIS. ISIS is making a fortune with oil.

BILL O'REILLY: So you stop their money flow?

DONALD TRUMP: And you know what? That's going to have a huge impact.

BILL O'REILLY: OK, but they're still going to try to blow our air (INAUDIBLE).

DONALD TRUMP: And now people are copying that idea.

BILL O'REILLY: They will still try to blow airliners out of the sky. All right? You don't need a lot of money to do that.

DONALD TRUMP: No, you don't.

BILL O'REILLY: And how're you going to deal with that?

DONALD TRUMP: You got to just stop it at the head. You have to do the best you can, you need tremendous (INAUDIBLE)...

BILL O'REILLY: Are you going to send ground troops in?

DONALD TRUMP: And frankly that could really louse up the world because, if somebody's a flyer, I mean you have people who don't like flying to start off with, and they see that scene of that plane where obviously the back of the plane was blown to pieces, it's a real problem. You're going to have to do some really strong things to make sure that threat goes away.

BILL O'REILLY: All right, but what I'm trying to get at, would you send ground troops into Syria to try to get these ISIS thugs?

DONALD TRUMP: Well, I told you what I'd to. I'd knock out their source of wealth.

BILL O'REILLY: All right, so wouldn't -- I'm going to take that as a no. So the 50 guys, the 50 Special...

DONALD TRUMP: No, no, no. Don't take it as a no. I (INAUDIBLE), but you know what I think is terrible? Obama sends 50 people over there, and these are 50 of our absolute finest, right.

BILL O'REILLY: Right, yeh.

DONALD TRUMP: You can imagine, they're all tremendous. Why does he have to announce it? He goes out and he tells everybody, he has a news conference. We are sending 50...

BILL O'REILLY: He wants to look like he's doing something...

DONALD TRUMP: No, no, but you can't talk about it. Do you think General Patton talked? Do you think General Douglas MacArthur talked about...? They shot first and they talked later. Obama goes out and he say we are sending 50 of our finest men to Syria. There's a target on those 50 men. If he would have kept his mouth shut, which he should have, nobody would even know.

BILL O'REILLY: Right.

DONALD TRUMP: Number one. Number two, it has to be more than that.

BILL O'REILLY: Of course.

DONALD TRUMP: And you have to go in and you have to do the job. And if Russia wants to help, I think that's great.

BILL O'REILLY: All right. The book, you're look like a mean guy on the book.

DONALD TRUMP: Yeh, I, I, I did.

BILL O'REILLY: Really a mean guy.

DONALD TRUMP: I know, I know. You know it's the worst picture I've ever taken.

BILL O'REILLY: Yeh, why'd you put the mean guy look?

DONALD TRUMP: I'll tell you what happened.

BILL O'REILLY: Yeh.

DONALD TRUMP: The book is a very, very strong condemnation of what's gone wrong with our government.

BILL O'REILLY: But there's a lot of whining in the book, you know that, on your part?

DONALD TRUMP: No, no, and there's also a lot of let's fix it, and how to fix it.

BILL O'REILLY: All right.

DONALD TRUMP: And that's what important.

BILL O'REILLY: But why the mean guy look?

DONALD TRUMP: I can't have "Crippled America" with a big smile on my face.

BILL O'REILLY: No, that's true. That's true.

DONALD TRUMP: And I had some nice pictures. You know Simon & Schuster these sent over these great photographers, and I had some beautiful pictures. And this is the worst picture I took. And everybody agreed that's the one I should (INAUDIBLE).

BILL O'REILLY: All right. It frightened children. Children are frightened by it.

DONALD TRUMP: I know, they'll get used to it.

BILL O'REILLY: OK, now, Saturday Night Live. Did you knock out any of the bits? Do you say this is...

DONALD TRUMP: We're doing some bits that are, I think going to be terrific.

BILL O'REILLY: OK, but did you knock out any bits that they brought to you?

DONALD TRUMP: Yes, I had to. There were a couple that were too risque.

BILL O'REILLY: Too risque, wow!

DONALD TRUMP: Yes, too risque. Because, you know, the poll just came down. I'm leading in Iowa. I want to stay leading in Iowa. Does that make sense to you?

BILL O'REILLY: So they gave you veto power or knocking stuff out, huh?

DONALD TRUMP: Look, we all agree Lorne Michaels is terrific. He's a terrific guy. You like him, I like him, we all like him, he's very talented. And we sit down and we look at like 30 -- they have all these writers...

BILL O'REILLY: Yeh, they have a million writers.

DONALD TRUMP: They have a hundred writers. I walk into -- there are a hundred, and they're all about 17 years old, OK? They're all young. The whole thing is crazy. But they come up with many, many skits, and you pick the ones you think you like...

BILL O'REILLY: Right. Is this going to be funny? Is it worth staying up late?

DONALD TRUMP: I think some of it is going to be really great.

BILL O'REILLY: Right, yeh?

DONALD TRUMP: I think so.

BILL O'REILLY: Yeh? And you're not allowed to ad lib. You got to stay on script there.

DONALD TRUMP: They don't want you to (stray) because there's the cameras...

BILL O'REILLY: Yeh, they don't want you wandering around.

DONALD TRUMP: They don't want a lot of nonsense, yes.

BILL O'REILLY: OK, so you're happy about this, this "Saturday Night Live" thing?

DONALD TRUMP: Well, it's work. I'm leaving here, I'm going over there for some more time. It's work.

BILL O'REILLY: Yeh, rehearsal.

DONALD TRUMP: A little rehearsal. But, you know, it should be a great evening.

BILL O'REILLY: All right. We will see. Thank you for coming in.

DONALD TRUMP: Thank you very much.

BILL O'REILLY: We really appreciate you taking the time.

DONALD TRUMP: A great honor.

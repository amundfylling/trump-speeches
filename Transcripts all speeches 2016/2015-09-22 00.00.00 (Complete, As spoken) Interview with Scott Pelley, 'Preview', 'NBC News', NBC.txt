SCOTT PELLEY: We were with you in New Hampshire when that man stood up.

DONALD TRUMP: Yes.

SCOTT PELLEY: And said we have a problem in this country, and it's Muslims. You let that pass. I wonder what that tells us about you.

DONALD TRUMP: Well, he said much more than that. He went on to say other things. It was part of the statement. He then went on to say other things.

SCOTT PELLEY: But the bigotry part.

DONALD TRUMP: Look. He said mostly about Obama. That whole question is about that. I don't have to defend President Obama. He is not going to defend me. So whether you agree or don't agree, and there were people in that audience as you probably notice, that did agree with him.

SCOTT PELLEY: It was a testing moment for a man running for president.

DONALD TRUMP: I don't think so.

SCOTT PELLEY: You never know when they are coming.

DONALD TRUMP: I don't think so.

SCOTT PELLEY: But here, you have a bigot.

(CROSSTALK)

DONALD TRUMP: You don't know that. I mean, he asked a question. You don't know he was a bigot.

SCOTT PELLEY: The problem in this country is Muslims?

DONALD TRUMP: Well, let me ask you this. So you said there is a problem in this country and it's Muslims. All right. I love the Muslims. I have many, many friends, people living in this building are Muslims. And they are phenomenal people. Unlike everything else, you have people where there are problems. Now, we can say there no problems with the Muslims, there's no problem, there is no terrorism, there is crimes, and there is no anything. They didn't knock down the World Trade Center. To the best of my knowledge, the people that knocked down the World Trade Center, they didn't fly back to Sweden.

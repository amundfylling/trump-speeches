DONALD TRUMP: How would you like to have a party win -- and he is married to a great lawyer so she understands this better than Wayne does, but Wayne has a much better voice, right? But how would you like to have a party where myself and others travel the country and work for a long time -- that was shorter than I thought, because remember I was supposed to maybe be able to pull it out pulled it out two months before the convention. Do you remember?

(APPLAUSE)

Do you remember when they said 1,237, that is the delegates, 1,237, he cannot reach that number. He cannot reach that number. And I kept saying, what is the big deal? And one of the people who probably has not quite given up yet, one of the people was trying to buy up all of the second ballot people, right? And I kept saying, let them have them because it's expensive to get them.

And by the way, I spent less money than any other candidate and I ended up in first place, and they ended up boom.

(APPLAUSE)

So now I hear after beating them fair and square -- I mean, I beat them fair and square. Actually a couple of the commentators that are negative people, actually, because most of them are, but a couple of the commentators that are negative people said whether you like him or you don't, he beat them fair and square.

(APPLAUSE)

And then they said, he didn't beat them by a little bit. He beat them by a lot. We beat them by a lot, right?

(APPLAUSE)

So how would you like to have a somebody goes out and beats them by a lot and wins not only the vote, largest in the history of the party, not only wins 37 states and nobody else was even like remotely close. I mean, some of these guys have none. How would you like to have that? A guy sets an all-time record, gets almost 14 million votes over a period of like nine months, he gets 37 states.

He gets tremendous support. He has sold out arenas no matter where he goes. Yesterday in Houston people said they have never seen crowds like that. One of the reporters, a very good reporter actually from NBC --

(BREAK)

Well, he's waiting for really the FBI to do what everybody thinks they're going to do. I mean, I think that's it.

(CHEERS)

I think he started saying, look, oh, let's hang in there, because ultimately it's called the FBI convention and then we'll be the only people and we will have done something like Trump did. I want to be like Trump. I want to be like Trump.

(BREAK)

It's the Republican Party, and I hope they will come together because I want them to come together. It's great. If for any reason they get a little like they don't want to help out as much, I'll fund my own campaign. I'd love to do that. I'd love to do that. You know, right now, I'm raising a lot of money for the Republican Party. A lot of beneficiaries to that and I like doing it.

But we have to have help. We have to have help. You know, life is like a two-way street, right? It's a two-way street. So, they have to -- otherwise, I'll keep what I'm doing, I'll keep funding my own campaign. I'm OK with that. That's the easy way.

We have raised a lot of money for the Republican Party. We will keep doing it because we do have tremendous support within the party. That I can tell you, we have tremendous support.

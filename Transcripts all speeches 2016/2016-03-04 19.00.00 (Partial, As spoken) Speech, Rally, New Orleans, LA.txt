DONALD TRUMP: ... close to me in Michigan. And in New York, we're going to give her an awfully big run. I think we're going to win New York because New York has been let down.

You know, upstate New York, they didn't allow them to frack. And the place loves Trump. I've been saying, Why wouldn't you let it -- do you know if they fracked in New York, New York would lower its taxes, would have no debt, would have made a fortune.

Instead, Pennsylvania took all their money, just like you never saw anything -- they took that -- oh, they took those beautiful, beautiful natural resources. They took them out.

Sort of funny. Pennsylvania, you have a line. You have the fracking equipment all up and down that line. In New York, you have nothing. In Pennsylvania, they're driving Cadillacs just like at the Cadillac World Championship at Trump National Doral. I'm supposed to be there now, and I'm in Louisiana and I'm very happy, OK? I'm very, very happy.

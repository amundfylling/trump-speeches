JOE SCARBOROUGH: And John Heilemann, (INAUDIBLE) chair to Donald Trump.

JOHN HEILEMANN: See you.

JOE SCARBOROUGH: Welcome.

DONALD TRUMP: Sit down, Joe.

JOE SCARBOROUGH: Have a seat right here.

MIKA BRZEZINSKI: Oh, yeah.

JOHN HEILEMANN: I yield my chair.

JOE SCARBOROUGH: Very good to see you.

(APPLAUSE)

MIKA BRZEZINSKI: Miccing him up.

JOE SCARBOROUGH: So, obviously, we were telling people about the event last night -- 4 to 5,000 people in a snow storm. And I'm just wondering how you're feeling this morning -- Iowa, obviously, all the polls had you ahead.

DONALD TRUMP: A little bit.

JOE SCARBOROUGH: All the polls have you ahead here.

DONALD TRUMP: I thought I won Iowa.

JOE SCARBOROUGH: Yeah, you -- little -- well, you actually hit your vote total that you expected to get. Cruz just go more people out.

How do you feel this morning?

DONALD TRUMP: How did -- how did he do that? How did he get those extra votes?

JOE SCARBOROUGH: Yeah. How are you feeling this morning?

DONALD TRUMP: I feel good, I feel good. We had a great night and it was an amazing event in a snow storm, in a blizzard. So, I feel very good.

JOE SCARBOROUGH: I saw a New York Times article that talked about a townhall meeting you had, I think in Merrimack. And the reporter was saying that it actually -- you were -- you were very at ease in that smaller group. And actually questioned why you didn't do that more in New Hampshire?

DONALD TRUMP: Well, the problem is, we call the events -- and I like to do those events -- and then, you know, 2,000 people show up. So, they're not working. And then we have thousands of people outside, and we have to tell them, I'm sorry, you have to go home. We only have room for 40.

And I like those events, every -- I did a couple of them, and I love them.

JOE SCARBOROUGH: Yeah.

DONALD TRUMP: But so many people come that it's sort of not right. Mark understands that, because he has seen it.

JOE SCARBOROUGH: Yeah.

MIKA BRZEZINSKI: So, we're hearing a lot about potential upheaval tonight, with outsiders perhaps taking New Hampshire -- you and Bernie Sanders. We hear about upheaval in the Clinton campaign, maybe them changing strategy, needing to do that.

And even potential that by March, Michael Bloomberg might jump into the race. What do you make of all that?

DONALD TRUMP: Well, he's a friend of mine, I hope he jumps in, because I love the competition. I would love to see Michael in the race, actually.

I think he should do it. Actually, I think I'll call him later and say, "Do it."

(LAUGHTER)

MIKA BRZEZINSKI: Do you think he would be a candidate, or are you saying...

DONALD TRUMP: Yeah, I think he's good. He's different.

JOE SCARBOROUGH: Was he a good mayor?

DONALD TRUMP: He was a good mayor, he had a rough last four years, I will tell you that. A really rough four -- I think he would have been much better if he didn't take to third term.

You know, he fought like hell to take -- he was term limited.

MIKA BRZEZINSKI: I agree with that.

DONALD TRUMP: And spent a lot of money on doing a lot things.

MIKA BRZEZINSKI: Changing it.

DONALD TRUMP: He got a third term. And then, there was a snow storm, it was a disaster. And I think he would have been a lot better if he didn't take the third.

JOE SCARBOROUGH: So, you're talking about him spending a lot of money. You haven't spent a lot of money.

One of the critiques I hear about your campaign is that you have got to improve your ground game, moving forward. Are you going to invest a lot of your money, since you're not taking other people...

DONALD TRUMP: Yeah.

JOE SCARBOROUGH: ... into building ground games in South Carolina...

DONALD TRUMP: Yeah.

JOE SCARBOROUGH: Across the deep south, and some of the other key states?

DONALD TRUMP: Sure. Well, I'm $45 million under budget. By this time, I thought I'd spend X -- what have I spent, $12 million or $15 million, and most of it is paying myself back for my airplane. I haven't had to do a lot of advertising. And you know, I go -- I don't know if I'm a believer in polls or not, but I go by the polls and I do a lot of television and you can't do that much television, and then on top of it, you have an ad and then more television and an ad. People would say I can't watch this guy anymore. So I'm way -- I mean, I'm at least $45 million under where I thought I'd be at this point.

JOE SCARBOROUGH: So you think you might invest that in your ground game moving forward?

DONALD TRUMP: I might. I mean, we're going to see. I've invested a lot of money. Actually, one of the reasons I've done commercials and they are actually positive commercials, is because I feel guilty. I feel guilty that I didn't do any commercials and we made a commercial, it was a good commercial and put it on, but -- and I also don't want to take a chance, you know? I don't want to be like a wise guy and think I don't have to do.

So we put on a commercial, it's a good commercial. Yes, we're going to -- you know, we have a big -- a big, big group of people in South Carolina tomorrow, tremendous amounts of people showing up. So we -- look, it's about make America great again. Very simple thing. We have a -- just make America great again. You saw it last night, a lot of people saw it last night and that's what we're going to do.

(APPLAUSE)

MIKA BRZEZINSKI: Willie Geist.

DONALD TRUMP: I don't know who he is. I don't know, but I like him.

MIKA BRZEZINSKI: He -- yes, he has a sign he wants to give you.

DONALD TRUMP: Does he? Oh, wow.

WILLIE GEIST: Donald, in public at least, you're not the most reflective or sentimental person I know. But if you think about...

DONALD TRUMP: But in private?

WILLIE GEIST: Perhaps in private you are. But if you think about yourself a year ago before you made the decision to get into the race, you were thinking about your businesses and perhaps a new season of The Apprentice. Could you have ever in you wildest dreams imagined you sitting here on this day, primary day in New Hampshire, as the favorite to win this state?

DONALD TRUMP: Well, I -- I'll tell you. First of all, I know this state very well because I've been here long before politics. I have many friends that live here and I'm up here and it's an incredible state. And I know the pluses and minuses. I mean, the minus is that they have a tremendous heroin drug problem and I'm going to stop it. I'm going to build a wall. I'm going to stop -- and I'm going to stop it so fast, even beyond the wall, long before the wall goes up. I'm going to stop it, and they really need that.

And you know, it's the first question I get. When you think of New Hampshire you don't think of that, but it's the first question I get all the time, the heroin, the drug problem. OK. I would say, hey look, you know, I like to win and I've won over my life. I mean, that's what I do, I win. I -- I -- I didn't go in it to lose, but if you would have told me that like a national poll just came up you probably saw it, I think it was an NBC poll where I'm like 15 points up nationally and we are up quite a bit here.

But the people have to go out and vote, you know? You see rallies like that where you have 4,000 or 5,000 people in a blizzard, and then you still have to tell them -- that's why I told them last night, no matter how you're feeling, you have to go out and vote.

WILLIE GEIST: But have you been surprised along the way at how well you've done? I mean, when you stood at the top of that escalator on June 16th, did you think you'd be the here as the favorite to New Hampshire?

DONALD TRUMP: Well, I'm happy about it. And I've given up a lot. And you know, it takes guts to run for...

WILLIE GEIST: But are you surprised?

MIKA BRZEZINSKI: He's not.

DONALD TRUMP: No, not that surprised.

(LAUGHTER)

JOE SCARBOROUGH: We finally get him to tell the truth. You know, they -- you know, you can tell he's not a southern politician because that's a false modesty. I'll tell you what...

MIKA BRZEZINSKI: I can't believe how much you all love me.

JOE SCARBOROUGH: No, I'm not surprised. No.

DONALD TRUMP: You know, Willie, I had to give up The Apprentice because Steve Burke came up to see me and they wanted to renew for two seasons of The Apprentice. That's a hard thing to give up, you give up prime time television, you give up a lot of deals. I don't do deals anymore, this is all I'm doing. I mean, I'm lucky my children are very good and they're running the company and they're going to do great.

But you give up a lot. I mean, when you give up a prime time television show -- you know, it sounds very trivial, it's a lot to give up.

JOE SCARBOROUGH: It is. Andrea Mitchell?

ANDREA MITCHELL: Let me ask you about Mike Bloomberg, because you say he was a good mayor, at least for the first two terms, you're a friend. But he says if he gets in, and he's now talking seriously about it, it's because he's disappointed in the conversation in both parties. Clearly, he would hurt the Democrats more than the Republicans. He's pro, you know, gun control, he's in favor of abortion rights, on all the social issues. So he would really cut into...

MIKA BRZEZINSKI: He would be coming in to stop you.

DONALD TRUMP: Well, you know, he's...

ANDREA MITCHELL: But he would -- he would really...

DONALD TRUMP: ... got very different views from me.

ANDREA MITCHELL: He could end up electing...

DONALD TRUMP: He and I have very different views.

ANDREA MITCHELL: ... you if you were the nominee.

DONALD TRUMP: I did him a big favor. He had a horrible project that was a total mess. It was under construction for 25 years at least and he couldn't get it built. No matter what they did, they couldn't get it built. I took it over and got it built in less than a year. And I said I'm going to get (INAUDIBLE) his is last term. I said I'm going to get it open for you before you leave and I got it open in October and he left in January.

WILLIE GEIST: What was the project?

DONALD TRUMP: The big project called Ferry Point in the Bronx. It was a disaster. Probably under construction for 30 years and I got it done. I really got -- I...

JOE SCARBOROUGH: So let me ask you, how did you...

DONALD TRUMP: I did him a big favor.

JOE SCARBOROUGH: I always ask leadership questions, this is a good leadership question to ask. How did you get it done?

DONALD TRUMP: Because I know how to build, I know how to get it done. I mean, that's what I do. The thing I do best is build. When you have an infrastructure of a country like ours that is absolutely decaying and rotting and falling apart and we -- by the way, we're spending $5 trillion in the Middle East instead of doing what we're supposed to be doing. We have to knock the hell out of ISIS and all, but we have to get back to rebuilding our country because you look at our airports, our roadways, our tunnels, our bridges -- 67 percent of them are in trouble.

JOE SCARBOROUGH: Have we wasted too much money over the past decade fighting wars? Has that been one of the biggest...

DONALD TRUMP: Well, I'll tell you what, I don't mind fighting, but you have got to win and number one, we don't win wars, we just fight, we just fight. It's like a big -- like you're vomiting, just fight, fight, fight.

(LAUGHTER)

We don't win anything. I mean, if you're going to fight, you win and you get back to rebuilding the country. We don't win. It's really a terrible thing. I mean, our country used to win all the time. We don't win at all anymore.

MARK HALPERIN: Given that you're poised to win this primary, given your standing in the national polls, given the trouble Hillary Clinton is having, are you the favorite to be the next president of the United States right now?

DONALD TRUMP: You know, I just don't know, Mark, I can't answer that question. I'm just -- you know, I go day by day, and I work hard, and I'm doing a lot of stops, even today I'm doing five or six stops. I think we're doing well.

I mean, I see the response. You saw the response last night. I mean, that's typical. I see the response, and we get by far the biggest crowds, far bigger than Bernie, Bernie doesn't get anywhere near where we get.

Now, I will say this -- he gets the second biggest crowds, he gets bigger than any other Republican. But I see the response and the response has been amazing.

ANDREA MITCHELL: What do you make of it?

MARK HALPERIN: You talk about -- you talk about trade and obviously immigration. What other issues that you're talking about do you think are resonating with voters? Is your tax plan, for instance, (INAUDIBLE)?

DONALD TRUMP: Well, I think health care is very big, I think tax plan. Interestingly, the tax plan is a massive plan that is going to cut taxes for everybody, but people don't care as much about that as some things. What they really care about is safety, and they really care about the border, they talk about the border, they love the border, they love the wall.

I mean, last night, I said who is going to pay for the wall? The whole crowd goes crazy -- "Mexico, Mexico!" Which, by the way, is true. Although the head of Mexico said, "No way, " and I said, "Now the wall just got taller."

(LAUGHTER)

But no, they love the security. You know what's different? When I first announced, it was trade with China and others that are ripping you us off like you wouldn't believe, and that we can do easily. But it was trade and it was, you know, the border.

After Paris, Paris had a big impact, then it became, really, security for the country. An amazing difference, I switched. And the polls actually switched, the polls had me No. 1 by far on that issue, because I think of my stance on the border.

But really now, I think it's security more than anything else.

ANDREA MITCHELL: What do you make of the fact that some people, some voters say, they can't decide between Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders. What is the common thread here?

DONALD TRUMP: Well, I can understand it in a certain way. We have one thing strongly in common, the difference is he can't do anything about it, I can. Trade. He knows we're being ripped off by every country we do business with, because we have people that are very, very stupid or very, very political that are negotiating our trade deals.

In many cases, they're political hacks. He knows that and I know that. The difference is I will take our trade deals and make them incredible for us. He can't do anything about it, because it's not his thing. He will never be able to do that.

ANDREA MITCHELL: And let me ask you about something that did happen last night, because people have criticized the tone of this campaign. What was going through your mind when that woman shouted a word out and you went with it and sort of...

DONALD TRUMP: I didn't -- we were all just having fun. It was a great moment, I got a standing ovation, the place went wild. Somebody said mixed cheers. Let me tell you, the place went wild.

ANDREA MITCHELL: No, I saw that.

DONALD TRUMP: Standing ovation. You know, you're talking about close to 5,000 people. standing ovation, went totally wild. And all I was doing is repeating, because people couldn't hear it, so I was doing everybody a favor.

MIKA BRZEZINSKI: OK, so before we go, because you seem...

DONALD TRUMP: Does that make sense?

(APPLAUSE)

MIKA BRZEZINSKI: You think on your feet so well.

DONALD TRUMP: The world of politically correct.

MIKA BRZEZINSKI: Oh, good Lord. I'm scared to do this, actually.

DONALD TRUMP: Go ahead.

MIKA BRZEZINSKI: So, we've been doing with all the candidates word association before we go. This is making me very nervous.

ANDREA MITCHELL: Are you sure you want to do that after last night?

JOE SCARBOROUGH: Yes, yes, you do.

MIKA BRZEZINSKI: All right. One word, Donald, OK?

JOE SCARBOROUGH: Or a phrase (INAUDIBLE).

MIKA BRZEZINSKI: But -- but -- you have got to go. OK, Jeb Bush.

DONALD TRUMP: Loser.

(LAUGHTER)

MIKA BRZEZINSKI: OK.

JOE SCARBOROUGH: What a coincidence.

MIKA BRZEZINSKI: It's so funny you should say that. Marco Rubio.

DONALD TRUMP: All right. Confused.

MIKA BRZEZINSKI: Ted Cruz.

DONALD TRUMP: I was going to say nasty. He's not really nasty, I mean, he has been very nice, he only goes on and off. I'll say nasty.

MIKA BRZEZINSKI: Nasty, OK.

JOE SCARBOROUGH: Stick with it.

MIKA BRZEZINSKI: Hillary Clinton.

JOE SCARBOROUGH: She went to your wedding.

MIKA BRZEZINSKI: Wow.

DONALD TRUMP: Yeah. She did. She did. She did. In a certain way, evil. In a certain way, evil.

MIKA BRZEZINSKI: Whoa. Bill Clinton.

DONALD TRUMP: Intelligent.

MIKA BRZEZINSKI: Hey, I mean, just stop there. I'm good, I'm good.

JOE SCARBOROUGH: OK.

WILLIE GEIST: I'm interested in all the words that he edited out.

MIKA BRZEZINSKI: I know.

(LAUGHTER)

JOE SCARBOROUGH: No. There was a lot of editing.

(CROSSTALK)

DONALD TRUMP: I never like that stuff, because...

MIKA BRZEZINSKI: Oh, yes. One more. Donald Trump.

DONALD TRUMP: Brilliant.

(LAUGHTER)

WILLIE GEIST: That one was easy.

DONALD TRUMP: Now, Putin said, "Trump is brilliant, " right? And the Republicans wanted me to disavow his statement, he's a horrible person and all.

I said, "I'm not going to disavow that statement. Why would I ever disavow that statement?" No, I'm only being a nice guy. I would say nice person, I'm a nice person.

JOE SCARBOROUGH: All right. Donald Trump.

DONALD TRUMP: A lot nicer than people think.

JOE SCARBOROUGH: I don't know if Hillary Clinton would agree with that in morning. But Donald Trump, thank you so much for being with us.

MIKA BRZEZINSKI: I know some people who do. Donald Trump, thank you. Andrea Mitchell, thank you as well.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

So we've been doing with all the candidates, word association before we go. This is making me very nervous.

UNIDENTIFIED: Are you sure you want to do that after last night?

MIKA BRZEZINSKI: Do I want to do this?

JOE SCARBOROUGH: Yes. Yes, you do.

MIKA BRZEZINSKI: OK. Word one, Donald. OK.

(CROSSTALK)

OK. Jeb Bush?

DONALD TRUMP: Loser.

MIKA BRZEZINSKI: OK.

(LAUGHTER)

JOE SCARBOROUGH: What a coincidence?

MIKA BRZEZINSKI: So, funny, you should say that. Marco Rubio.

DONALD TRUMP: Confused.

MIKA BRZEZINSKI: Ted Cruz.

(LAUGHTER)

DONALD TRUMP: I was going to say nasty, he's not really nasty. I mean, he has been very nice. He goes on and off. I'll say nasty.

MIKA BRZEZINSKI: Nasty. OK.

JOE SCARBOROUGH: Next question.

MIKA BRZEZINSKI: Hillary Clinton.

JOE SCARBOROUGH: She went to your wedding.

MIKA BRZEZINSKI: Wow.

DONALD TRUMP: She did. She did. She did. In a certain way evil. In a certain way evil.

MIKA BRZEZINSKI: Whoa. Bill Clinton.

DONALD TRUMP: Intelligent.

MIKA BRZEZINSKI: I mean, we should just stop there. I'm good. I'm good.

DONALD TRUMP: ... up, thank you, darling. I love you, too. I love you, too. I thank you.

But it has been an amazing journey. It has been an amazing journey, and it has been incredible, because I've really gotten to know the people of our country, and they are incredible, incredible people. They are unbelievable people.

(APPLAUSE)

And they want to see us making great trade deals, and they want to see us strong at the borders, because otherwise, we don't have a country. And they want to see people come in that really want to be here, and they want to love us, and they don't want to do harm or hurt us. They want to see that.

And if they don't see that, they're not happy. And there are a lot of people right now that are not happy, and we're not going to take it any longer.

(APPLAUSE)

Now, we'll talk about jobs and we'll talk about the economy, and we'll talk about all the things that I talk about, and where I seem to be hitting a cord. And you know, part of the reason I hit a cord because from an actual real wage standpoint, people are making less money today than they made 18 years ago, and they're working harder, they're working longer hours. And it's not good, folks. It's not good.

But we had an event, a horrible, horrible event this weekend in Orlando, where 50 people -- they say 49, but it will soon probably be 50 -- people are so badly injured, and so badly wounded sitting in hospitals. Unthinkable.

And when you listen to the stories of what took place and the laughter as this man was shooting incredible people, you say to yourself, "How can this possibly be happening in the United States of America? How can this be happening?"

And we have to be tough and we have to be smart, and we have to be vigilant. We have to be vigilant. And we have to have people report other people when they see things happening, because they're not doing that. They're not doing it. They're not reporting people, and they have to do that.

It's all right. That's OK. And -- this house is packed. Boy, we are packed. This is amazing. Yeah, you can get him out. Or if he wants, he can stay, I don't care. I don't care. I don't care. So, look, we have to be strong and we have to be smart. We can't let these happen any more. Right? Do you agree with me, protester, do you agree? Or do you think it's easy to be weak and ineffective, like we are right now? Do you think that's OK?

(APPLAUSE)

I don't think it's OK. I don't think it's OK.

So, we have a situation, and I say this, and I'm going to read it. I'm -- on the other side -- I think she finally won, by the way. I think she finally won. Crooked Hillary, Crooked Hillary, ladies and gentlemen. She's as crooked as they come, as crooked as they come.

So you have Hillary. I think Bernie is now out of it. Right. Is he finally out out? Is he gone? Boy.

So I was criticized in the newspapers because I've had a staff of 73 people at the top. And I won in a landslide. She has a staff, they say, of 873 people, and she goes on and on and on. And the paper said, "She has many more people than Trump; she has many... " And I'm saying to myself, "Wait a minute, they're making it sound like that's bad for me."

Isn't it great? When you can win with a much smaller group of people? Isn't that what we want?

(APPLAUSE)

And much less expense?

(APPLAUSE)

I've spent a fraction of what she spent winning. It's like when I went to, I mean, so many places, every state. I won so many of the states and I have such great experience, including Georgia. Boy, did we win Georgia.

(APPLAUSE)

We won in a landslide, Georgia. And I hear we're looking like we're going to win it big in November. We have to. We're going to win it big. That's what it's looking.

(APPLAUSE) But I went to New Hampshire, and -- and there's something special about New Hampshire because that was where we had our first victory, first of many. And the people were amazing. But I went to New Hampshire and I went in there and I got to know the people, and I saw what was happening. And I spent a tiny fraction of what the favored candidate was spending. I won't say who the favored candidate was. But I spent just a little bit, and I won New Hampshire in a landslide. And I won other states in a landslide.

And I spent -- and by the way, I spent my own money. I was spending my money. I didn't raise money. I spent my money.

(APPLAUSE)

I didn't have people giving me millions and millions of dollars from Wall Street. But you know what? I won New Hampshire in a landslide. I said to myself, nobody covers it. They said, "Well, Trump did it on the cheap." I didn't do it -- I'm, like, we're intelligent people.

Wouldn't it be great if we had somebody like that running our country? Wouldn't that be great? Wouldn't it be great?

(APPLAUSE)

So now they're saying, "She has built a massive team; she's got almost 900 people; she's spending money." And Trump has 73 people. But you know, we're doing very well. Watch what the end result is. Watch what the end result is.

(APPLAUSE)

And -- and when you look at the phony poll numbers that I'm seeing, take a look at the poll numbers from right after this horrendous and horrible and something we have to stop fast attack. Take a look over the last couple of days, because I'll tell you, people are tired. They want to have strength. They want to have intelligence. They don't want to make an Iran deal. The Iran deal, where we give them $150 billion. We get nothing. We get nothing.

They don't want to have trade deals where China has got a trade deficit, we do with China, of $505 billion a year; where we have trade deficits, massive trade deficits with Mexico, with Japan, with Vietnam, with India, with everybody, folks, with everybody.

I mean, practically every country in the world when they do business with the United States, it's called "let's rip them off." It's like we're all the big, bad dummies. Those days are over if I win. Those days are over. They're over.

(APPLAUSE)

Now, I just want -- I have to talk about this for just a little while because of the horrible situation that we all just saw, and saw so vividly. But we have to talk about it, and then we're going to get on to other things. But it's so important because I've been talking about it for a long time. And I've been saying it's going to happen. And I hate to say it again, but it's going to happen again and again and again. Because we're not doing what we have to be doing. It's going to happen again and again and again. And we are not doing what we're supposed to be doing. We are taking in thousands of people into our country. We have no idea where they come from, we have no idea who the hell they are.

We know they believe in certain things that we don't want to believe in. You know, I said the other day, and I said it very strongly. I have great respect for women.

(APPLAUSE)

If you look at what Hillary Clinton has done -- I have tremendous respect. If you look at what Hillary Clinton has done with women, No. 1, from certain countries, her foundation has taken millions, tens of millions of dollars from countries that want to enslave women. Enslave -- want to enslave women.

As far as the gay community, they kill gays. And she's taking money in. And now, she wants to allow them to come into our country, pretty much unvetted, because every law enforcement person that I've spoken to and that you watch and that you read is saying it's very hard, if not impossible, to check out people. There's just no papers. There are no papers.

And yet, you see this great migration, which is a horrible thing to watch -- and by the way, I have a heart as big as anybody else. We have to build safe zones over there. And we have to take care of people.

(APPLAUSE)

Let's build safe zones, but bill them over there. Build them in Syria. Build them in places over there.

(APPLAUSE)

Thank you. We have to build safe zones. We have to work. You know, it's humanity. It's humanity. But we have so many problems here. But we build safe zones over there, and now here's where the deal making comes in or whatever you want to call it. We have to get the Gulf states to pay for it.

They have tremendous amounts of money. They're not doing much. And it's their territory. And we have to get them to pay for it. We have to get them to pay for it. We owe $19 trillion right now. We owe $19 trillion right now. We have Hillary, who wants to bring people in, spend billions and billions of dollars on bringing people in -- as to whether they assimilate or not, you make the decision. But assimilation has not been exactly a positive factor.

So, she wants to spend all of this money, and her increase on bringing these people in is 550 percent more than Obama, who doesn't have a clue. He doesn't know what he's doing, OK? He doesn't know what he's doing.

(APPLAUSE)

Very sad. It's very sad. So when you look at Sharia, and you look at the beliefs of Sharia -- and it's called execution for things that you would say or, like, standard parts of life, what they do to people. And we have people coming in -- and do not kid yourself, that's what they believe. That's what they want. That's what they practice. And we're taking these people in.

So I will tell you, the LGBT community, the gay community, the lesbian community, they are so much in favor of what I've been saying over the last three or four days.

(APPLAUSE)

A friend of mine called up -- a friend of mine called up. He said, "You know, you don't get enough credit, because in Palm Beach, you opened a club that nobody would do, nobody would do, and it's open to everybody. It's open to everybody."

And a person, a member of the club, great guy who's gay, wrote this magnificent letter saying what Donald Trump did, nobody else would do. And we are getting a tremendous -- thank you, thank you. We are getting a tremendous amount of credit, because over the last three days, people are realizing -- over the last three days, people are realizing what's going on.

And we have to -- we have treat people great, but we have to treat everybody great. It's not to be -- you know, when I say "Make America great again, " it's great again for everybody. We have to say for everybody.

We have to.

(APPLAUSE)

Thank you.

And you know, we have a simple theme. It's called make America great again. Now, a lot of people say I copied from Ronald Reagan. I didn't because his theme was different. I didn't even know this, but it's called -- his was let's make America great. That's different. We are make America great again.

But we're adding to it because we really have to add and I'm adding. As we go along, as we get older and wiser, make America great again, make America safe again, and let it include everybody because that's what we have to do. We want it to include everybody. OK? We want it to include everybody.

(APPLAUSE)

And we have to stop on a temporary basis, at least, but we have to stop people from pouring into our country. We have to stop it until we find out what the hell is going on. And we can do that, but we have to have people come in that cherish us, that love us, that want to love us, that want to do things, that don't want to destroy us, that don't want to go to a club where you have innocent people and where you had no guns on the other side.

By the way, I'm going to save your Second Amendment. OK? I'm going to save your Second Amendment.

(APPLAUSE)

If some of those (INAUDIBLE) that were in that club that night had guns strapped to their waist or strapped to their ankle, and if the bullets were going in the other direction aimed at this guy who was just open target practice, you would have had a situation, folks, which would have been always horrible, but nothing like the carnage that we all, as a people, suffered this weekend. Nothing.

(APPLAUSE)

And a lot of people aren't just realizing this. You know, you take a look at Paris. Paris has, they say, the toughest gun laws in the world. France, generally speaking, the toughest in the world. And these thugs walked in. They used to call them the press master minds. I said, you can't call them master minds. That's why the young kids are joining. They're joining ISIS. They want to be a mastermind.

But thugs, these thugs. I call them the guy with the dirty white cap, the thugs walk into different places. Boom, boom, boom. There was nobody with -- nobody on the other side. There would -- nobody could do anything. And they got killed; 130 people killed, viciously killed. Hundreds still in the hospital with the most horrible injuries. And now we have the same thing in Orlando.

And then last night, you had a police officer and his wife were killed the same way. And he put it over Facebook. The killer put it on Facebook. Same kind of a thing. And it's happening all over and it's getting worse. And it's going to continue to get worse until they respect us, folks. They've got to respect us. They have no respect for us whatsoever.

(APPLAUSE)

We're trying to be nice. We have a president who wants to be so politically correct that he doesn't want to use the term radical Islamic terrorism, doesn't want to use it. He gives a speech yesterday, a long speech that at the end of it, nobody knew what the hell he was talking about. Nobody knew. He's trying to justify why he won't use it and he said radical Islam because he didn't want to use the word terrorism. You noticed.

Why he won't use that term or why he doesn't use it and how it doesn't make difference, but it does make a difference. It makes a difference and it makes a big difference because unless you're willing to discuss and talk about the real nature of the problem and the name of the problem, radical Islamic terrorism, you're never going to solve the problem.

And then Crooked Hillary Clinton gets up the other day, and she wouldn't use the term. She wouldn't use it. But I was hitting her hard on it. Very hard. And finally, she gets up and she said, "I would use it."

She would -- you know. And by the way, the press didn't report this. They said she used the term. They didn't say about Trump. Many of them. Some are fair, but many of them -- most of them are very dishonest. It's very hard to get the word out, I'm telling you.

It's very hard to get the accurate word out. Because I made a speech yesterday in North Carolina. We got standing ovations, a packed house. I go back and they're talking about the speech -- it, like, had nothing to do with what I was even talking about.

They are the worst, believe me. But Hillary Clinton gets up and she sort of acted like, no problem using the term. And she said, "I would use the term." But she didn't use it. But she didn't call it radical Islamic terrorism. She said radical Islamism.

And I'm not saying that's wrong. Let's see how much she uses it. You know, she'll basically do whatever Obama wants her to do. You understand why, because that whole thing is just ridiculous what is going on there.

That's just ridiculous. How that can happen in our country today is absolutely one of the great insults to law enforcement. And let's see what happens. But she's being totally protected. She is being 100 percent protected.

Now, maybe we'll all be surprised. And maybe our laws will work the way they're supposed to work. But you know what, folks? I think if something was going to happen on the crimes that have been committed, I would have assumed it would have happened already, don't you think? Don't you think?

So let's see what happens. But when you get right down and you look at it, we have got to be respected. We don't have to be liked so much. We have to be respected. I don't want to be feared. You could take it another step -- fear, it's not fear.

We have to be respected. We're not respected by these people. They come into our country, they want to take it over. Now, look at what's happening in Germany. A catastrophe. I have friends from Germany that for 20 years, have been telling me how great Germany is. What a great place to live.

Some of these people are leaving country now. They're leaving. Their crime rate is through the roof. Things are happening that are horrendous. And you see what's happening to women. You see what's happening all over Germany now.

It was a horrific mistake. It was a terrible mistake.

Now they'll say it wasn't. It's wonderful. You build, as I said, and if Germany had it to do again, I don't think she would admit it -- and let's see how she does in the next election, assuming there's going to be an election and she's going to run.

But if Germany had it to do again, I'm sure they would put up billions of dollars to do as I said, safe zones in Syria, make them nice, anything's cheaper and anything's better than what's going on now in Germany and other countries.

(APPLAUSE)

So, Belgium is a beautiful city and an amazing place -- magnificent buildings. I was there many, many years ago. And I had always this incredible image. And a number of months ago I made this statement, something to the effect, Belgium is a hellhole.

And I was badly criticized. They said what a terrible thing, and then they had the massive problem in Belgium. And people said, Trump was right. Trump was right. I don't want to be right. I don't want to be right. I don't want to be right.

But you look at what's going on in Paris. You look at what's going on in different places all over, different places. You know it, I know it. They know it. They don't want to talk about it.

We don't want to have these problems, and we've already got them. Look at this weekend. We don't want to have these problems.

So what I'm saying is, it's a temporary ban, in particular for certain people coming from certain horrible -- where you have tremendous terrorism in the world, you know what those places are. But we have to put a stop to it.

We have to put a stop to it, until such time as we can figure out what is going on. Because right now, we don't have a clue what's going on, folks. We don't have a clue.

We don't know even a little bit what's going on. And we have to be the smart country now. We've been the dummies for too long. We have to be the smart -- we have to be the brilliant country. We have to show, and we have to help and we have to take care of people, but we have to be smart.

With the kind of money that we owe, $19 trillion, going to $21 trillion very shortly because of the omnibus budget that was passed -- going to $21 trillion, we can't be doing this and this isn't even the money. This is beyond the money because even if you had a small percentage of people coming in thinking like this person, who again, was born here, but his parents weren't and his ideas weren't born here. His ideas were born from someplace else.

(APPLAUSE)

And in speaking to numerous governors over the last few days, really a great group of people, and in speaking to them, they really are beside themselves because they say people are being put in our states and they have absolutely nothing to say about it. They don't know who they are, where they are, they don't know where they're being placed.

And even from the standpoint of law enforcement, that's a bad thing because they can't watch, they can't see -- they can't see what's going on. And we aren't vigilant and we aren't smart. And we have to go and we have to maybe check, respectfully, the mosques, and we have to check other places because this is a problem that, if we don't solve it, it's going to eat our country alive. OK? It's going to eat our country alive.

And we can be weak and we can be ineffective like we are now. Right now, everything is political correctness. If you watched Obama's speech yesterday, it was really all about political correctness. There's nothing wrong with being strong. There's nothing wrong with being smart. It was all about political correctness. And we have to make sure -- thank you.

We have to make sure, so important, that we now go down the right path, because we're going down a wrong path and our country is in serious trouble. OK? All right. Serious trouble.

Now, we have a lot of things going on in addition -- in addition. And right now, there is no addition because of what happened, but in addition, we have things going on that are terrible. We're being eaten alive on the jobs market. Our jobs are being taken out of our country. If you look at what's happened as an example with NAFTA, yes, right? NAFTA has taken our jobs out of our country, brought them to other places.

Thank you very much. Thank you, very respectful person. Thank you. Thank you. By the way, somebody just said, and you're right, I was fully endorsed, I think it was the earliest endorsement ever by the National Rifle Association, the NRA. So that was good. Thank you.

(APPLAUSE)

So when I started on June 16th, almost one year ago -- thank you. I always say be nice to our protester. Be nice to our protester. Be very gentle. Be very, very gentle. All right. Thank you.

I have to tell you -- by the way, is there any better place to be than a Trump rally? In all fairness, right? Is there any better place to be? I'll tell you. A friend of mine said to me, "Look at this crowd. Up there, it's packed. I can hardly see them up there." There's so many lights. Thank you. This place is packed.

But of friend of mine, very, very successful guy, came up to me and he saw the rally in Dallas where we had 20,000 -- 21,000 people in the Mavericks Arena. He saw the rally in Mobile, Alabama where we had 35,000 people. He sees these massive rallies and look at this today. And a lot of people outside trying to get in. Would anybody like to give up their seat? Let some people in? No?

So -- but he saw these big places and this is one of the most successful people and he came with me and he said, "How the hell do you do that in front of so many people?" And I told him and I absolutely mean this, I said, "It's easy because there's so much love in the room." It's true. There's so much love in these rooms. It's incredible.

(APPLAUSE)

And you know, it's really true. I mean, it's easy in a sense because there is great love and it's people that want to see our country do great thing, do wonderful things, be strong again. They want their jobs back, they want their wages to go up. They want their wages to go up. They want to manufacture things again.

You look at the manufacturing in our country -- when I won New York and Pennsylvania and Connecticut and Maryland and all these different places especially, but when I won New England, we won tremendous. We won Massachusetts. That's because Tom Brady likes me, but you know.

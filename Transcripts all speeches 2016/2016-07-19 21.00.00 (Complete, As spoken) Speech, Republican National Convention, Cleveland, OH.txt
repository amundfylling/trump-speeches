DONALD TRUMP: Are you having fun?

Melania and I had such a great time last night, an unbelievable evening. Today has been a very, very special day watching my children put me over the top earlier. The party seal, I mean, what we did, getting the party's nomination, I'll never forget it. It's something I will never, ever forget.

A little over one year ago I announced my candidacy for president, and with your vote today, this stage of the presidential process has come to a close.

Together we've achieved historic results with the largest vote total in the history of the Republican party. This is a movement, but we have to go all the way.

I'm so proud to be your nominee for President of the United States. I look forward to sharing my thoughts with you on Thursday night on how we build a brighter and more hopeful future for all Americans.

It's an honor to run on a ticket with Governor Mike Pence, who is an incredible man, and who will make a great, great vice president.

I'll be with him in Cleveland tomorrow night, and we'll be together again on Thursday night. And, by the way, we are going to win the state of Ohio, and also, of course, we're going to win the presidency and bring real change and leadership back to Washington. This is going to be a leadership, by the way, that puts the American people first. We're going to bring back our jobs. We're going to bring rebuild our depleted military and take care of our great veterans. We're going to have strong borders. We're going to get rid of ISIS, and we're going to restore law and order, we have to restore, and quickly, law and order among many. And just so many other things.

And, I'll be discussing with that Thursday night. We'll be talking all about it.

But, together, most importantly, we are going to make America great again. Have a fantastic evening. I'll see you tomorrow night. I'll see you on Thursday night, and we will win in November. Thank you.

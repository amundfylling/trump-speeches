MIKA BRZEZINSKI: And Donald Trump joins us now on the phone. Donald, congratulations.

JOE SCARBOROUGH: Donald -- Donald, are you feeling more presidential this morning?

DONALD TRUMP: Yes, yes I get...

MIKA BRZEZINSKI: Oh, stop it.

DONALD TRUMP: ... more and more presidential.

JOE SCARBOROUGH: No, no. no, no. Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.

MIKA BRZEZINSKI: What? What?

JOE SCARBOROUGH: He's going to sound presidential, hold on. Sound presidential for us.

DONALD TRUMP: I get more and more presidential as I have victories, absolutely.

MIKA BRZEZINSKI: Sounds like he's lying in bed.

DONALD TRUMP: No, I'm not.

MIKA BRZEZINSKI: OK.

JOE SCARBOROUGH: You sound really excited to be on Morning Joe.

DONALD TRUMP: I am. It's always exciting.

JOE SCARBOROUGH: What a night. Talk -- talk -- talk -- OK, yes, he's being presidential, intentionally boring.

MIKA BRZEZINSKI: All right.

JOE SCARBOROUGH: It's -- it's -- it's wonderful. The first time it's happened. All right, so -- so should Ted Cruz and John Kasich drop out of the race?

DONALD TRUMP: They should have. In fact, I heard they were having a news conference last night to drop out of the race and they canceled the news conference. So, I don't know. Look, they have to play their game. John is now 1 for 47 and Ted is, you know, a disaster. I guess I'm 3.5 million votes up on him or something. It's -- it's a crazy thing. It's crazy. And they have no highway, it's over. So I think we're doing very well. I think we're going to do very well in Indiana. We have the great Bobby Knight endorsing me tonight, which I look forward to, and it's going to be exciting.

JOE SCARBOROUGH: So, can you -- are -- are you ready to predict that you're going to get to 1,237 and more when it comes to delegates?

DONALD TRUMP: Well, I've been saying that for a month. I think we're going to get it. I think we're going to get it fairly easily and I think we're going to have an amazing -- I think we're going to do great in Indiana, I think we're going to do great in California, and I think there's some states in between that we're going to get.

JOE SCARBOROUGH: Are you -- are you going to start turning your attention now to Hillary Clinton and the general election?

DONALD TRUMP: A little bit. I want to finish off the final two leftovers, you know, two guys that shouldn't be here. And you know, for the sake of the Republican party, they shouldn't, because we want to unify the Republican party. But I have two people that are still here hanging around, as the expression goes, not going to get anywhere. And -- but it's going to take time and, you know, t's a process. You have to wait a week and then you have to wait another week.

Instead of that, we could be raising money for the Republican party, a lot of it. I have a lot of friends who would give a lot of money to the Republican party. And you know, we -- we're not going to do it until they find out whether or not I win. I have friends that are going to give tremendous amounts of money to the Republican party.

JOE SCARBOROUGH: Yes. Were you surprised last night by the scope of the victories?

DONALD TRUMP: Yes.

JOE SCARBOROUGH: Yes, talk about that.

DONALD TRUMP: Well, the scope was fantastic. You know, I was told if I get 50 it's good, and I was told that you couldn't get 50 in all of them because, you know, getting 50, Joe, you and I discussed this and I discussed it at length last night, but getting 50 is very tough when you have three people.

MIKA BRZEZINSKI: Right.

JOE SCARBOROUGH: Right.

DONALD TRUMP: And you know, if you look at where I won by 60 and 62, and last week it was 62 in New York, and you have three people, I mean, if you had 62 and you had one person, that's considered a landslide victory, right? And if you win by 5 points, you know, if you're one on two, it would be, you know, really, really amazing. Now, I mean, if you win on a one-on-one by 5 points that's considered pretty much of a landslide, right? So I'm getting, you know, essentially 60 percent against two other candidates.

JOE SCARBOROUGH: Yes.

DONALD TRUMP: Pretty amazing.

JOE SCARBOROUGH: Are you -- are you at this point, I mean, you have to be thinking about vice presidential picks. Are you starting in your, excuse me...

DONALD TRUMP: I am in my own mind, but I don't want to talk about him because I don't want to even think about it until this is over. You know, I heard Cruz is going to start to think about vice -- you know, vice presidential picks. He may -- he may pick Carly Fiorina. And, oh, I see Rhode Island, I'm just looking at your screen, Rhode -- Rhode Island is 64. That's a good number.

JOE SCARBOROUGH: Yes, hey, Donald, listen, by the way, we wanted to talk to you about that. That appears to be your ceiling...

MIKA BRZEZINSKI: Yes.

JOE SCARBOROUGH: ... and maybe you should just kind of drop out of the race.

DONALD TRUMP: I know. And it's my ceiling with three people, Joe.

JOE SCARBOROUGH: Yes.

DONALD TRUMP: It's not my -- don't forget, if I had two people, the 64 would have been 80.

JOE SCARBOROUGH: Hey, why has -- I wrote a column about it in The Washington Post  we've been talking about it for nine months now, why has the media -- and we've had this running joke, Trump's ceiling 25, it's 30, it's 35, poor guy should get out of the race.

Why has the media underestimated you so badly at every turn? Well, I mean, you -- you've been seeing it, you've been living it, you actually paid a compliment to the media last night, I ask you why you did that. But also, why have they misread you so badly over the past nine, ten months?

DONALD TRUMP: Well, I'm an outsider. I don't play by the traditional rules. I'm self-funding my campaign which maybe has an impact on them. And you know, I think the media is under pressure and I think they look very bad because when I came out, they all said I was going nowhere. I wouldn't announce. You folks were great, but not everybody was. I wouldn't -- and you gave me a hard time, too, even. But they said I wouldn't announce.

JOE SCARBOROUGH: When did I give you a hard time?

MIKA BRZEZINSKI: Well no, we gave you a hard time on things we disagree with, but we always thought that your candidacy was successful.

JOE SCARBOROUGH: Yes, we always -- we always said...

MIKA BRZEZINSKI: Which is -- we don't understand the people who didn't get it. Mike Barnicle has a question.

MIKE BARNICLE: Donald, congratulations on your...

DONALD TRUMP: Hey, Mike.

MIKE BARNICLE: ... crushing sweep last night, first of all.

DONALD TRUMP: Thank you. Thank you.

MIKE BARNICLE: Secondly, of -- of all the candidates on both sides of the aisle in the course of this campaign, you have the most resonant campaign message, let's make America great again. It's clearly identifiable. People have clung to it and listened in to you for the past several months. So in your mind, what period of time, or what specific year do you want to make America akin to in the past? What -- what year or decade or generation would it be?

DONALD TRUMP: None, because I think we can make it better than it ever was. I think we can actually make this country better. I think if Hillary Clinton gets in, it will never have the opportunity again, because we're going down fast. We're really going down fast. If she gets in, we will never have the opportunity. But -- so there's really none.

The -- we're going to have our own era and it's going to be a great era. And there are so many things we can do to make our country rich again, and great again and respected again. And I would say none, Mike.

MIKA BRZEZINSKI: All right, so...

DONALD TRUMP: There were some interesting times, but -- but you're going to see something -- we will make America greater than ever before.

MIKA BRZEZINSKI: Donald, last night, Hillary Clinton spoke about you during her victory speech, and it was specifically about gender. Take a look.

DONALD TRUMP: Oh.

(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)

HILLARY CLINTON: The other day, Mr. Trump accused me of playing the, quote, "woman card." Well, if fighting for women's health care, and paid family leave, and equal pay is playing the woman card, then deal me in.

(END VIDEOCLIP)

MIKA BRZEZINSKI: It seems that would be the one area where perhaps you -- I mean, I don't know what -- you -- you say you have plans for Hillary, but I would think she's incredibly strong on those issues.

DONALD TRUMP: Well, I haven't quite recovered, it's early in the morning, from her shouting that message. And I know a lot of people would say you can't say that about a woman, because of course a woman doesn't shout. But the way she shouted that message was not -- oh, I just -- that's the way she said it, and it's -- I guess I'll have to get used to a lot of that over the next four or five months.

MIKA BRZEZINSKI: Well, what about issues pertaining to women that she discussed, including equal pay and right to choose?

DONALD TRUMP: Oh, we'll -- we'll do -- we're going to do very well. We're going to do very well with Hillary and with women as soon as we start our process against her. We're going to do very well. I don't even know if it's going to be Hillary. I mean, we're all waiting to find out what happens with the email scandal. I -- I don't know what's going on with the email scandal. It's taking longer and longer.

JOE SCARBOROUGH: Yes.

DONALD TRUMP: She's -- she's guilty. Everybody knows she's guilty, but they don't want to -- they don't want to go after her. I -- it's going to be an interesting thing, but she's got a problem because people at the far left are sitting in jail cells.

MIKA BRZEZINSKI: I don't think she's guilty...

(CROSSTALK)

JOE SCARBOROUGH: So, you said Hillary Clinton was shouting her message. I think Bernie Sanders shouts his message, too, right?

DONALD TRUMP: Well, Bernie Sanders has a message that's interesting. I'm going to be taking a lot of the things that Bernie said and using them. I can re-read some of his speeches and I can get some very good material. He said, you know, in many ways she shouldn't be there. He said some things about her that are actually surprising, you know, that essentially she has no right to even be running and she's got bad judgment. When she said -- when he said bad judgment, I said, sound bite. But Bernie has been very effective, been treated very badly by the Democrats and by the Democratic party and, frankly, should run as an independent, I think.

NICOLLE WALLACE: That would work out great for Republicans.

MIKA BRZEZINSKI: Nicole.

JOE SCARBOROUGH: By -- by the way, Nicole -- Nicole is here, and her parents were texting her furiously all last night, a good night for Nicole's mother and father.

MIKA BRZEZINSKI: Yes, they're -- they're very -- cheered.

DONALD TRUMP: Well, congratulate them. They -- I like -- I like Nicole's parents.

NICOLLE WALLACE: They -- pass along the same to you.

DONALD TRUMP: Nicole is a very beautiful, nice woman, but I like her parents perhaps better.

(CROSSTALK)

NICOLLE WALLACE: Yes, fair enough. You're giving a national security speech today and I think there's a lot of anticipation created in part by the lengthy interviews you gave to the The Washington Post  editorial board and "The New York Times " editorial board. And I think even you would acknowledge there's a lot of filling in to do about the kind of foreign policy you would execute as president.

I wonder if you could take us behind the scenes for that process. Did you put some of your favorite generals, or thinkers or writers on the plane? Did you debate out some of the, you know, long held conventions about our alliances? Tell us about the process, not just how it was written, but about how you arrived at what you're going to detail today?

DONALD TRUMP: Well, we did. We had a lot of very good experts, I'll be naming them today, that helped people of great consequence. I will say that a lot of people that I've -- I've looked at have great names and they've been involved with nothing but failure. You know, they have wonderful names. Oh, you should use general so and so, and you should use this one and that one. And they've been -- but they've been involved for a long time with the strategy of our war -- war plan, which has been going on for...

NICOLLE WALLACE: So, no one involved in -- I'm sorry, but no one -- so you view Iraq and Afghanistan affair, so you -- no one involved in either going to war or executing the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan is anyone you would consider to be part of your foreign policy team.

DONALD TRUMP: Well, they are considered and I am using some, but I will tell you that there are some that I just couldn't take it anymore, you know, when they're giving me their credentials. One guy walked in, Mr. Trump, I've been involved for 14 years at the highest level of the Iraq war. And I said, well, I would really not be interested in using you, sir, and all due respect and we'll forget about you. And you know, we need new thinking. We need a lot better thinking because this is ridiculous. What's going on for so many years is ridiculous.

And you know, whether we like it or not, there are people out there that haven't had a claim but maybe I like their ideas better. So we have combinations of both. I'll be announcing names later, but we have combinations of both they're very, you know, very good people. All very good -- everybody is a good person, but some ideas just haven't been working and when I see people, you know, like Lindsey Graham working on the war floor as long as he's been in the Senate, and then he says I've been doing this for many years. Well, that's the problem. It shouldn't take many years. It might take many months, it might take many weeks if we had the right people.

JOE SCARBOROUGH: John Hilemann.

JOHN HEILEMANN: Donald, congratulations. I'm looking forward to this -- to your speech today. I'll be down in Washington to hear you.

DONALD TRUMP: Good, John.

JOHN HEILEMANN: I've got a question about your campaign. I've heard various descriptions now of the roles that Corey Lewandowski and Paul Manafort play. Some people say that, you know, one of them is the CEO, the other one's the COO. You know, I'm putting it in business terms. I'd just like to hear you describe how you see their respective roles and what they do for you within the campaign.

DONALD TRUMP: OK, so let's go back to the beginning. We started with Corey, and Hope and a few people, right? When everybody said, oh, well, Trump's only going to do this for a few weeks and he's not going to have much fun. And I didn't start with -- I didn't start with Hillary where she had 8 or 900 people sitting in an office, in a finished office space in Brooklyn because she has money from PACs and everything else.

You know, when you fund your own money, even though I have a lot more money than any PAC, than all the PACs put together, I like to watch my money. I mean, you know, I just sort of like it. I don't know. It's an old habit.

And -- and what happened -- what happened -- so, we have a -- actually, but far the best in the history of campaigns, we have the best locations. Joe, would you say that's right, and Mika? In the history of campaigns we have the best location, OK.

JOE SCARBOROUGH: It is. You...

MIKA BRZEZINSKI: It's a...

JOE SCARBOROUGH: .. could afford to build it out a little bit.

MIKA BRZEZINSKI: It's got cement walls.

JOE SCARBOROUGH: But I -- but I don't...

DONALD TRUMP: No, I don't want to build it out. No, it's...

(CROSSTALK)

... concrete walls...

(CROSSTALK)

JOE SCARBOROUGH: Concrete walls, wires hanging down.

DONALD TRUMP: I already have the space rented for a fortune. The day -- the day the campaign ends, I get the highest rent in the city. The day the campaign ends, I'll build it out for a computer company. You know, it's one of those things.

JOE SCARBOROUGH: Yes, yes, yes.

DONALD TRUMP: So, it's fine.

JOE SCARBOROUGH: All right.

DONALD TRUMP: But -- but I like it in concrete. To me -- I like -- I actually like it in the concrete, so the other looks sort of ridiculous to me. And there's a rough space, so, we have -- we have that. And it started off, and we came in in Iowa second, a close second, got no credit for it, and Marco got a lot of credit for coming in third. I came -- got no credit for coming in second. It's a race that I could have -- should have come in first actually, and because I had -- I had the votes, but the caucus process was not a process that -- that I frankly ever heard of, OK? You know, I had -- I had -- I'd been doing this for a of couple months.

JOE SCARBOROUGH: Hey, Donald, you're -- you're locking down the nomination and you're still going back to Iowa.

DONALD TRUMP: No, no, they asked me about the campaign.

MIKA BRZEZINSKI: You remind me of someone I know.

DONALD TRUMP: No, no, they asked me about the campaign.

JOE SCARBOROUGH: OK.

DONALD TRUMP: So, then we went to New Hampshire, I won it, we went to South Carolina.

JOE SCARBOROUGH: Right.

DONALD TRUMP: We went to all these states and I started winning like crazy and have been winning ever since. But the campaign has gotten bigger, it's evolved, right? And so, we started with Corey as the manager and Hope doing a lot of work. Hope is terrific, too. And all we're doing is adding more people.

JOE SCARBOROUGH: Yes.

DONALD TRUMP: Now, Paul actually gets along very well with Corey. They get along. They have different functions. And they are -- the functions are broken up. But I brought -- I brought Paul in because a very, very smart friend of mine who knew him very well said he is fantastic, OK, and -- and he's somewhat political, my friend. He's actually a very successful businessman, but he's -- he's a political type.

JOE SCARBOROUGH: Right.

DONALD TRUMP: He loves politics, like -- like all of you. And he said this guy is fantastic. I brought Paul in, and Paul has done a really good job. And the two guys get along, the only time they don't is when a phony paper like Politico will write a story that has no bearing in truth, I mean, no bearing whatsoever. This Politico rag, they -- they write stories that are so false with no comment and they never call me. They never ask me for a quote. You know, I'm the only one that does -- honestly, I'm the only one that matters because I'm the -- it's my campaign.

JOE SCARBOROUGH: You're the one in charge. Let me ask you about...

DONALD TRUMP: And they don't even call me to ask.

JOE SCARBOROUGH: Yes.

DONALD TRUMP: Like they would -- they should call me. How are they doing? And I say, they get along great.

(CROSSTALK)

MIKA BRZEZINSKI: It's not like you're not available.

DONALD TRUMP: And then -- and then I'll read a story that is so unbelievably bad, but they don't call me to ask me that question, so they can never know the answer.

JOE SCARBOROUGH: Right.

DONALD TRUMP: But I'm telling you, they get along really well.

JOE SCARBOROUGH: Doing fine, OK.

DONALD TRUMP: They -- they have separate functions, very separate functions, and they're doing great.

JOE SCARBOROUGH: So, let me ask you, in closing, you had said that Bernie Sanders -- by the way, I just want to go back. Yes, we -- we have been critical of you from time to time, but we've never questioned, like everybody else, whether you were going to win this thing or not because it seemed obvious to us, especially Mika, from the beginning, that you would.

DONALD TRUMP: Well, Mika knows talent, I will say. She's like a talent scout.

JOE SCARBOROUGH: Exactly, she's been trying to get me fired for nine years.

DONALD TRUMP: She -- she knows -- she knows great talent.

JOE SCARBOROUGH: Yes, she does.

DONALD TRUMP: And Jeb Bush does, because in the midst of the campaign, Jeb Bush said Donald Trump, he calls me Mr. Trump, Mr. Trump is a gifted politician. So...

(CROSSTALK)

JOE SCARBOROUGH: There you go.

MIKA BRZEZINSKI: Yes, you are.

JOE SCARBOROUGH: So, there you get that.

MIKA BRZEZINSKI: I think you're more than a politician.

JOE SCARBOROUGH: So -- so let me ask you, let me ask you though, you had said last night that Bernie Sanders was not being treated fairly by the Democratic party. You said it again this morning.

MIKA BRZEZINSKI: I agree with that.

JOE SCARBOROUGH: And yes, we -- we certainly agree with that. They have been -- that process has been rigged from day one. Let me ask you, though, on the Republican side, how is the RNC treating you? Are you being treated fairly...

MIKA BRZEZINSKI: Are you talking with them?

JOE SCARBOROUGH: .. and with sufficient respect? And if you win the nomination, are you going to clear out the RNC and get new leadership there, are you going to keep Reince Priebus and everybody else in place?

DONALD TRUMP: Well, I get along with Reince well, I like him a lot, he likes me, I think, as much as you can like somebody that is causing a little bit of difficulty by all these wins. You know, these wins were not supposed to be, they were supposed to pick a senator who would have lost, or they were supposed to pick a, you know, congressman generally, Senate -- not so much a congressman, but sometimes, or they were supposed to pick a governor. I mean, that was the way it was supposed to be.

Then you had Ben Carson come in. He's a -- he's a great guy, he endorsed me and he's a great guy. And he was effective, he was actually very effective. He was the most effective in a sense. And Chris Christie came in, a lot of them did well. A lot of them did much better than Kasich, but they didn't stay in. Now, you look Marco, as an example, Marco rubio has far more delegates than Kasich and -- and, you know, he didn't stay in. He said, well, it's -- it's -- I've got to get out now and he did the right thing. And Kasich should get out also.

I -- I think, Joe, that this is a campaign that has a lot of legs, it's a campaign that has a lot of -- a lot of good brain power, and I think it's a campaign that's just going to work right to the end.

JOE SCARBOROUGH: But -- but -- but are you going to work with the RNC or are you -- if you win the nomination, are you going to get a new group of people in there?

DONALD TRUMP: Well, I'm going to try, Joe. I think so. I mean, the campaign, the -- the -- and -- and to a certain extent the RNC inherited this, but this delegate system is a scam. It's a scam. Now, with that being said, in Pennsylvania I did really well, because I got the 17, plus I got many, many more that are already pledged that you -- I have -- I don't think have reported, but I have many. They have a great -- a great chairman there.

JOE SCARBOROUGH: Yes.

DONALD TRUMP: Rob Gleason. And I have -- a great -- really a great leader. And I got many, many delegates in Pennsylvania that you people haven't been reporting on because you don't know yet, and -- and it will be announced, but a lot of them. And you know, we did the whole pledge card thing.

JOE SCARBOROUGH: Yes.

DONALD TRUMP: And we -- but the -- but the whole system of -- of what's being going on, where I win in Louisiana and end up with less delegates.

JOE SCARBOROUGH: Oh, it's outrageous.

DONALD TRUMP: The whole system is a scam.

JOE SCARBOROUGH: And you know, right now, Donald...

DONALD TRUMP: And the whole system is rigged.

JOE SCARBOROUGH: Right now, Donald, we're -- we're showing showing...

DONALD TRUMP: Hey, Joe, the only way I...

JOE SCARBOROUGH: ... we're showing Pennsylvania right now. The entire state, it's all red. You won every county in the entire state. It is hard to believe that every single delegate there is not going to back you. If they don't, that is a scam and it's a rigged process.

MIKA BRZEZINSKI: They're not representing Pennsylvania.

JOE SCARBOROUGH: And I would be saying that...

(CROSSTALK)

.... I would be saying that if John Kasich or Ted Cruz won every county. You won every county...

DONALD TRUMP: Right.

JOE SCARBOROUGH: How do you not automatically get every delegate?

DONALD TRUMP: Every single -- by the way, every single county, so I should get every delegate. And in Pennsylvania they do have a morals provision where they will back, you know, they -- they're morally inclined to back if -- if you win, and I won everything there.

JOE SCARBOROUGH: Yes.

DONALD TRUMP: But I will say this, right now in Pennsylvania you have Lyin' Ted Cruz and his staff of honchos, and they're going around trying to pick-off people, they're taking them to breakfast, they're taking them to lunch, they're taking them to dinner. They're all over the place. And he lost the state, in fact, he did horribly in the state.

And you know, he only -- out of five states, I think he only came in second in one. I mean, Ted Cruz, in all fairness to John Kasich who should not be in it, 1-for-46, Ted Cruz last night came in fourth -- came in third in four states.

JOE SCARBOROUGH: Third, yes.

DONALD TRUMP: I mean, so I don't know. I don't know where he's going.

JOE SCARBOROUGH: Right.

DONALD TRUMP: Ted doesn't have the ability to get votes. Mika picked that up a long time ago, perhaps faster than anybody else. Mika gets nauseous when she watches this guy speak.

JOE SCARBOROUGH: Now, come on.

DONALD TRUMP: And frankly, Ted -- Ted Cruz...

MIKA BRZEZINSKI: I do, I do.

DONALD TRUMP: ... cannot -- I'm trying to be nice to you, OK?

JOE SCARBOROUGH: Stop.

MIKA BRZEZINSKI: No, I appreciate it.

DONALD TRUMP: Ted Cruz cannot get votes. The only way Ted Cruz gets votes is when -- when it's a scam deal. He'll go to Colorado where they don't vote, he'll go to Wyoming where they don't vote, he'll go to a caucus which the caucus is fixed. The guy can't get votes. He's not a good politician.

JOE SCARBOROUGH: All right.

DONALD TRUMP: And -- so, but he shouldn't be trying to pick-off delegates. We should get 100 percent of the delegates in Pennsylvania, and it looks like that's where we're heading.

MIKA BRZEZINSKI: We're looking at that story closely. We'll be watching. Donald Trump, congratulations.

JOE SCARBOROUGH: Congratulations. A huge night, Donald.

MIKA BRZEZINSKI: Thank you, Donald.

DONALD TRUMP: Well, thank you very much. I really appreciate it.

JOE SCARBOROUGH: All right. Talk to you soon.

DONALD TRUMP: Thank you.

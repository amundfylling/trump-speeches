BILL O'REILLY: Since I'm live at 11:00, I don't know who this guy is. He's been following me around all day. Now look, we're standing mano a mano here, you're not going to be taller than me. So the debate?

DONALD TRUMP: I thought they did a really good job. I enjoyed it. It was tough, but fair.

BILL O'REILLY: Who is your main competition in your opinion going forward? Come on, come on, no, no, stop, stop.

DONALD TRUMP: Well Ted Cruz seems to have, you know, he's second...

BILL O'REILLY: Yeah.

DONALD TRUMP: Quite a distance away but he's second. Marco would be third, the governor would be fourth.

BILL O'REILLY: And do you think that's the way it's going to shake?

DONALD TRUMP: Probably well, that's the way it is right now. It can change very rapidly.

BILL O'REILLY: All right. You look a little tired. Are you tired?

DONALD TRUMP: No.

BILL O'REILLY: No. OK. Romney hit you hard today. Are you surprised?

DONALD TRUMP: He's a failed candidate.

BILL O'REILLY: I know, I know. But were you surprised?

DONALD TRUMP: I'm just telling you, he did a horrible job, he wants to become relevant again. He really let us down. Four years ago I supported him and helped him a lot. He really, really let us down. He knows I feel it. And, I guess he felt it. He said that. But I think my retort was far stronger than his, and if you look on Twitter and if you look at what's happening, I think he made a fool out of himself if you want to know the truth.

BILL O'REILLY: Why do you think he did it?

DONALD TRUMP: Because I think he's a jealous guy and I think he'd like to run but he didn't have the guts to run this time. And he probably should have. I don't think he would have done very well and I told him he was a joker, I mean he's a joke artist and that's what happened with his last...

BILL O'REILLY: Do you think he's angling to going to the convention if you don't have enough delegates?

DONALD TRUMP: Well it might be, and that's why he didn't support anybody but he doesn't have, he would be beaten so badly by Hillary Clinton, your head will spin. So, he doesn't have it.

BILL O'REILLY: When you hear guys like Romney and there are not a few of them, there are many of them in your party.

DONALD TRUMP: Right.

BILL O'REILLY: Why do you think you engender so much loathing from them?

DONALD TRUMP: No and love, and love.

BILL O'REILLY: Yeah I mean, you have plenty of die hard supporters.

DONALD TRUMP: 65 percent and believe me, a big, big portion, if you look at all of the polls that are coming in now above 50. And I will tell you, a tremendous amount of the party loves what we're doing. You see the numbers of people, millions of people are joining the Republican Party. You can't say it's happening...

BILL O'REILLY: All right. You got a lot of detractors and people like Romney, you come out...

DONALD TRUMP: I think once it's over, I think people are going to get along, not everybody but people are going to get along with me well very well. I'm very much a unifier.

BILL O'REILLY: What about you, or personality engenders these people to come after you.

DONALD TRUMP: I tell it like it is. I tell the truth.

BILL O'REILLY: I mean, but Romney feels that you're a danger to the country.

DONALD TRUMP: I don't think he feels that at all.

BILL O'REILLY: Do you think he's a phony?

DONALD TRUMP: I would say he's a phony. Yeah, I mean (INAUDIBLE) at all.

BILL O'REILLY: Do you think this is all contrived.

DONALD TRUMP: I would say mostly contrived. I think he feels very badly about his poor run, he run very poorly. He made a fool out of himself, should have won that election, he went way for the final four weeks.

BILL O'REILLY: But why would he come back now though. I mean he's been out for so long.

DONALD TRUMP: Well I was hitting him hard because when he was going to come back, I was saying he was a choke artist. I mean he choked. He choked in the last campaign. I mean, he really, look he lost in the senate and he really lost twice for president, not just once. So he has three in the row. The worst guy we could have would be him.

BILL O'REILLY: But just jealous?

DONALD TRUMP: Ultimately, he went to see Jeb Bush and he was actually afraid of Jeb.

BILL O'REILLY: Yeah, you told that story in May. So just jealously eyes...

DONALD TRUMP: I don't know what it is. I don't know what it is. You'd have to ask him. But I think he made a fool out of himself he shouldn't have don't it.

BILL O'REILLY: Well your supporters are going to stay with you. I don't think there's any doubt about that. He's not going to change their mind. But you need to get on our calculations about 30 million people who are not supporting you now to support you to defeat Hillary Clinton.

DONALD TRUMP: I think I'm going to defeat Hillary because we're going to win Michigan. We might win New York. See, when I run, I have a whole different calculus. I have a chance of winning of New York. Nobody else does. We have a big chance of winning New York. We're going to win places like Michigan, I'm going to win Pennsylvania, I'm going to win Ohio. I'm going to win a lot of places, I'm going to win Florida. Florida is my second home. We're going to win places that nobody else is going to win and we're going to add states that nobody else can even think of.

BILL O'REILLY: But the downside is, that the Democrats are going to come over and look, you saw what happened with your own guys tonight, the Republican Party. The Trump University stuff. The flip flopping on issues. The campaign support for Carter and these people. You know, that's all going to be in play.

DONALD TRUMP: (INAUDIBLE) in the meantime, I have 49 percent in the polls, nobody is even close. I mean I'm at 49, they're at 15. So, you know, you can bring up, why don't you bring up a few more things.

BILL O'REILLY: No, it's my job. Come on.

DONALD TRUMP: Yes. It's called politics and I'm fine with it. And, if you look at what I've done, I've built an unbelievable company. You know that. I know that. Most of the people know that. And what I'll do is let it be known, I have buildings all over the world, we have jobs, it's going up all over the world. Very few people have built a company like I have built a company.

BILL O'REILLY: All right. Are you getting mad at guys like me when you ask negative questions?

DONALD TRUMP: No I know you'd become very negative. I do think.

BILL O'REILLY: Yeah me?

DONALD TRUMP: Yeah.

BILL O'REILLY: Why would I do that?

DONALD TRUMP: I don't know, who knows. You have to ask your psychiatrist. But I think you become very negative...

BILL O'REILLY: Toward you?

DONALD TRUMP: Yes. Do you know Melania?

BILL O'REILLY: Yes. Your better half.

DONALD TRUMP: It's true.

BILL O'REILLY: But it's not even close. But I want to get back to this. I think I have been very fair to you, very fair.

DONALD TRUMP: You've been fait but I think you get a little bit carried away with yourself, frankly.

BILL O'REILLY: Do you want to give me an example?

DONALD TRUMP: No, I'm not going to give an example.

BILL O'REILLY: Come on.

DONALD TRUMP: We're just finished a debate which I hear I just won based on all of the polls again. I won a lot of debates but I really had a good time tonight.

BILL O'REILLY: All right. When you are thinking ahead, I was surprised to hear you say you're going to support, if they give you the under table thing, at the convention, so you're coming in with not enough delegates, OK?

And they don't give you the nomination even though you have the popular vote by far, are you going to accept that?

DONALD TRUMP: Well look, I don't want to run as an independent. I love the Republican Party. It has been pretty nice to me.

BILL O'REILLY: I know you pretty well, though.

DONALD TRUMP: And the people, I tell you what. The people but you have to remember, I brought a lot of -- I brought millions of people into the Republican Party. That's why I'm doing so well.

BILL O'REILLY: That -- you're right.

DONALD TRUMP: That's why we have so many people. But, the best chance of winning is for me to run as a Republican. I will beat Hillary Clinton. These people will not beat Hillary.

BILL O'REILLY: OK. So you're going to -- even if they give you the runaround, even if they do bad things to you at the convention, it's possible.

DONALD TRUMP: It's always possible. The best chance of winning is to win as a Republican. Run as a Republican, and win. And I am far head of everybody. I'm leading by a lot. I think we're going to do very well over the next two weeks, also. People will be surprised at the amount of victory, the size of the victory. Even you were surprised.

BILL O'REILLY: I wasn't surprised. Come on now.

DONALD TRUMP: The Super Tuesday...

BILL O'REILLY: From the very beginning...

DONALD TRUMP: We're going to have other Super Tuesdays.

BILL O'REILLY: From the very beginning, I understood your appeal. Yes. Melania. Did you see the numbers on Greta last night for Melania, did you see those numbers?

DONALD TRUMP: Were they very good.

BILL O'REILLY: Yeah, they were much better than your number.

DONALD TRUMP: I'm happy...

BILL O'REILLY: So maybe, maybe Melania runs for V.P.

DONALD TRUMP: I think that's a good idea.

BILL O'REILLY: She kicks your butt...

(OFF-MIC)

All right?

DONALD TRUMP: She did. By the way she did a great job.

BILL O'REILLY: Look, it's nice of you to lead off the Factor at 11:00. OK. And if I'm unfair, you come on and tell me and give it to me, man.

DONALD TRUMP: I will. I promise.

BILL O'REILLY: All right. Thank you.

DONALD TRUMP: Thank you.

LESTER HOLT: You delivered a speech yesterday, you went hard after Hillary Clinton. She says your speech was full of conspiracy theories, and that you attacked her because you had no answers on substance. What's your reaction?

DONALD TRUMP: I attacked her because she has been terrible at what she does, whether it's Libya, whether it's the great migration that you see, which is largely her and certainly her and Obama. She's done a horrible job. You look all over Europe, it's a disaster what's taken place. And she'll be a terrible president. So the attack is an attack really on the fact that she will be a terrible president.

LESTER HOLT: You made some very bold claims about her that didn't stand up when we put it --

DONALD TRUMP: Well, you don't know if they stand up. What claim are you talking about?

LESTER HOLT: Well, let -- let's talk about your claim that she was asleep during the Benghazi attack.

DONALD TRUMP: He was left helpless to die as Hillary Clinton soundly slept in her bed.

LESTER HOLT: That Ambassador Stevens wasn't asking --

DONALD TRUMP: Were you there? Were you there? Were you with her?

LESTER HOLT: She has testified before the committee that she wasn't asleep, it happened during the daytime.

DONALD TRUMP: Mm-Hm. OK.

LESTER HOLT: There's no evidence that she was asleep.

DONALD TRUMP: It happened all during the day and the story was going on for a long period of time.

LESTER HOLT: But I -- I guess what I'm asking, what are you -- what do you -- what do you base that on?

DONALD TRUMP: Excuse me, it was going on for a long period of time. And she was asleep at the wheel -- whether she was sleeping or not, who knows if she was sleeping.

LESTER HOLT: Well, you said she was sleeping.

DONALD TRUMP: She might have been sleeping. She might have been sleeping. What? Because she put out a tweet, somebody said she put out a tweet, therefore she wasn't sleeping. Nobody else could put out a tweet? So, I don't know.

LESTER HOLT: So you stand by what you said?

DONALD TRUMP: I can tell you this. Whether she was sleeping or not, and she might have been sleeping, it was a disaster. It was a horrific disaster and it was on her watch.

LESTER HOLT: You also made the claim that her email, personal email server had been hacked.

DONALD TRUMP: Her server was easily hacked by foreign governments.

LESTER HOLT: Suggesting that as president --

DONALD TRUMP: Well, you don't know that it hasn't been --

LESTER HOLT: Wait a minute. But -- but suggesting that -- that she would be compromised as president. What evidence do you have?

DONALD TRUMP: Well, first of all, she shouldn't have had a personal server, OK? She shouldn't have had it, it's illegal. What she did is illegal. Now she might not be judged that way because, you know, we have a rigged system. But what she did is illegal. She shouldn't have had a personal server.

LESTER HOLT: But is there any evidence that it was hacked other than routine phishing attacks?

DONALD TRUMP: I think I read that, and I heard it, and somebody that --

LESTER HOLT: Where?

DONALD TRUMP: -- also gave me that information. I will report back to you. I will give it to you. I --

LESTER HOLT: But you -- you just said it with such certainty yesterday.

DONALD TRUMP: I don't know of certainty. I -- probably she was hacked. You know what, you -- you can be hacked and not know it. But she probably was hacked. The fact is, she should not have it -- she should not have had a personal server.

LESTER HOLT: You've been critical of Hillary Clinton for taking Wall Street money. Will you take Wall Street money?

DONALD TRUMP: I'm taking very little. I tell you, well we're doing very well --

LESTER HOLT: But you will take some?

DONALD TRUMP: I don't know. I mean, we'll have to see who comes up. I mean --

LESTER HOLT: But you won't take a pledge not to take Wall Street --

DONALD TRUMP: -- I have turned that -- let me -- let me tell you differently, I have turned down millions of dollars from people who I don't really want to give me money, OK? She's taking tremendous amounts of Wall Street money, but I put up my own money. Now, we've started raising money and I've gone to different events. And again, a lot of money is being raised for the Republican Party. I think you will be really surprised when you see the next report.

LESTER HOLT: Do you plan to debate her?

DONALD TRUMP: Of course I do. I look forward to it.

LESTER HOLT: Three times? You commit to three debates?

DONALD TRUMP: I think it's three debates, yeah.

LESTER HOLT: You plan on -- on doing them?

DONALD TRUMP: Sure.

LESTER HOLT: Are you preparing for the debates now?

DONALD TRUMP: I think my whole life has been in preparation, frankly. But yeah, sure, I'll be preparing like everybody else.

LESTER HOLT: You made an -- an appeal yesterday in your speech to Bernie Sanders voters to come over to team Trump. You're asking people who support a Democratic socialist --

DONALD TRUMP: Yeah.

LESTER HOLT: -- to come over --

DONALD TRUMP: Yeah.

LESTER HOLT: -- to you as symbol of capitalism.

DONALD TRUMP: It's true. That's true. Lester, you know what?

LESTER HOLT: Who just told me that he may or may not take Wall Street money.

DONALD TRUMP: OK. Let me just tell you why. Because I'm no fan of Bernie, but Bernie Sanders is right about trade. I mean, he's right. Now the difference between me and him is I'll do something about it. In other words, I will actually do something about it and take those horrible deals and make them great deals for the country.

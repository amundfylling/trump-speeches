DONALD TRUMP: He was getting ready to do it again. I don't want to hear it. Look, so we send, we send them wheat. We send them cattle. They don't want our cattle, so they send it back. Goes back and forth, back and forth. Finally, they accept it. They call it kobe beef because it's aged. I mean, the stuff is rotted.

(LAUGHTER)

No, no, it's, like, rotted. So because it's aged, it's decaying, it's disgusting, they call it kobe beef, and they charge you 10 times more for it. You tell me they're not smart? That's Japan. Japan is killing us. Komatsu -- look at what they're doing to Caterpillar. A friend of mine is an excavator. He buys excavating equipment, right? He goes out and he buys excavating equipment.

I say, What are you doing? You're not buying Caterpillar. I can't. They have cut the yen, they have devalued their currency to such an extent, first time in his life he's buying excavation equipment from Komatsu. I said, What's the difference? He said, They're both good, Caterpillar's better, but this is good enough. I owe it to my family, I owe it to my employees and my company.

I understand what he's saying. They've devalued their currency. Take a look at Caterpillar stock. Take a look at what's happening to Caterpillar. It's happening to all of us. Right here, you have Boeing. Boeing is being forced to build a massive plant in China, a number of massive plants.

(BOOS)

Folks, folks, let me just tell you something. Unless I'm president, you watch what happens. Won't happen with me because I know the game better than any human being that's ever lived. Nobody knows it better.

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

... in pig's blood. You heard that, right? He fit -- he took 50 bullets and he dipped them in pig's blood! And he had his men load his rifles and he lined up the 50 people, and they shot 49 of those people. And the 50th person. he said, You go back to your people and you tell them what happened.

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

And for 25 years, there wasn't a problem, OK, 25 years, there wasn't a problem, all right? So we better start getting tough and we better start getting vigilant, and we better start using our heads or we're not going to have a country folks. We're not going to have a country.

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

UNIDENTIFIED: This is the greatest country in the world.

DONALD TRUMP: What?

UNIDENTIFIED: This is the greatest country in the world.

DONALD TRUMP: It is. I love this country. That's why I'm doing this! I love this country! We want to keep this country.

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

We want to keep this country. We want to make -- look, I'll tell you something. I've been saying something because I've been meeting so many people, millions and millions of people. One of the reporters today, a great reporter, television reporter, said to me, I've been doing this, Mr. Trump -- and he didn't say this on the record and I wouldn't tell his name, but he said, I've been doing this for 25 years. In 25 years, sir, I have never, ever, ever seen anything like what's happening with you and with your people. It's amazing!

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

It's amazing.

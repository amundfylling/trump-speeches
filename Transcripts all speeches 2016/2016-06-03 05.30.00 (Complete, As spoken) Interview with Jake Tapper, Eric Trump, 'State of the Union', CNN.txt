JAKE TAPPER: Before Donald Trump jumped on that impressive jet to Redding, California, he sat down with me and he was quick to launch attacks at the Democratic frontrunner.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

Hillary Clinton was giving a speech. She had some very tough things to say about you.

One of the things she said...

DONALD TRUMP: She wasn't giving it, she was reading a speech that was written by other people, OK?

But go ahead.

JAKE TAPPER: OK.

DONALD TRUMP: Sound bites...

JAKE TAPPER: One of the things...

DONALD TRUMP: -- she (INAUDIBLE)...

JAKE TAPPER: -- one of the things she said was, "This is not someone who should have the nuclear codes. It's not hard to imagine Donald Trump leading us into war because someone got under his very thin skin." what's your response to that?

DONALD TRUMP: Well, first of all, I don't have thin skin, I have very, very strong, very thick skin. And when somebody is right about me, I always -- you know, if you do a report and it's not necessarily positive but you're right, I never complain.

I do complain when it's a lie or when it's wrong. But I have a strong temperament and it's a very good temperament and it's a very in control temperament or I wouldn't have built this unbelievable company, I wouldn't have built all of the things that I've been able to do in life.

I mean, number one best-sellers, one of the best-selling books of all time, tremendous television success...

JAKE TAPPER: I don't think anyone is...

DONALD TRUMP: I've been successful.

Well, wait a minute, Jake.

I've been successful in every business I've been in, if you think, real estate one of the most successful. Uh, television, The Apprentice  which is, forget it. I mean NBC came to me. They wanted to renew so badly you have no idea.

JAKE TAPPER: But what does that have to do with temperament?

DONALD TRUMP: (INAUDIBLE)...

JAKE TAPPER: You're very successful.

DONALD TRUMP: Oh, it has a lot to do. You can't...

JAKE TAPPER: There's no question.

DONALD TRUMP: Oh, you can't have that success without good temperament.

And I will say this. I was thinking about the word temperament. And we need a strong temperament in this country. We have been led by weak people, weak ineffective people. Countries have taken advantage of us, whether it's militarily or otherwise. We have been taken advantage of by everybody. We have people with weak temperaments.

I have a very strong temperament. But I have a temperament that's totally under control. And, you know, you -- she -- she mentions that I'll bring us into war. She's the one that wanted to go into Iraq. I mean she raised her hand. She didn't know what the hell she was doing. She raised her hand.

I said, I don't want to go into Iraq, Iraq is going to destabilize the Middle East and I was 100 percent right.

JAKE TAPPER: I want to ask you about comments you made about the judge...

DONALD TRUMP: Sure.

JAKE TAPPER: -- in the Trump University case.

DONALD TRUMP: Sure.

JAKE TAPPER: You said that you thought it was a conflict of interest that he was the judge because he's of Mexican heritage, even though he's from Indiana.

DONALD TRUMP: (INAUDIBLE).

JAKE TAPPER: Hillary Clinton said that that is a racist attack on a federal judge.

DONALD TRUMP: Oh, you know, she's so wonderful. You know, I mean here's a woman that should be put in jail for what she did with her emails and she's commenting on this.

JAKE TAPPER: But what about (INAUDIBLE)...

DONALD TRUMP: Let me just tell you...

JAKE TAPPER: (INAUDIBLE).

DONALD TRUMP: -- let me just tell you (INAUDIBLE).

I have a case where thousands of people have taken this course and thousands and thousands of people have said great reviews, great reviews. Fortunately, just about everybody that took the courses have signed a review, an evaluation, they call it. And it's gotten tremendous marks. Thousands -- I don't mean like two people, I mean thousands of people.

JAKE TAPPER: Right.

DONALD TRUMP: OK. I have a situation where the woman that brought the case brought the case. She's the plaintiff. She was deposed. She was found to be a disaster for them as a witness, because she gave an evaluation that was like the best evaluation you've even heard -- wait just one second.

JAKE TAPPER: OK.

DONALD TRUMP: And she did a tape like from your camera saying that this school was fantastic. It was fantastic.

They went to the judge and they said, your honor, we don't want her anymore to be our plaintiff so we said let's dismiss the case. That's OK. Let's dismiss the case.

And he said, no, I won't dismiss the case and she doesn't have to be the plaintiff

JAKE TAPPER: But what --

DONALD TRUMP: Let me tell you...

JAKE TAPPER: -- does that have to do with his heritage?

DONALD TRUMP: I'll tell you what it has to do. I have had ruling after ruling after ruling that's been bad rulings, OK?

I've been treated very unfairly. Beforehand, we had another judge. If that judge was still there, this case would have been over two years ago.

Let me just tell you, I have had horrible rules. I've been treated very unfairly by this judge. Now, this judge is of Mexican heritage. I'm building a wall, OK?

I'm building a wall. I am going to do very well with the Hispanics, the Mexicans (INAUDIBLE)...

JAKE TAPPER: So no Mexican judge could ever be involved in a case...

DONALD TRUMP: Well?

JAKE TAPPER: -- that involves you?

DONALD TRUMP: No, he's a member of a society where, you know, very pro- Mexico and that's fine. It's all fine. But I think...

JAKE TAPPER: Except that you're calling into question...

DONALD TRUMP: -- I think he should...

JAKE TAPPER: -- his heritag

ERIC TRUMP: -- recuse himself...

JAKE TAPPER: Because he's Latino?

DONALD TRUMP: -- then you also say does he know the lawyer on the other side?

I mean does he know the lawyer, the, you know, a lot of people say yes. I don't know.

JAKE TAPPER: But I'm not talking about that.

DONALD TRUMP: Well, no, that's another...

JAKE TAPPER: I'm talking about the...

DONALD TRUMP: -- that's another problem.

JAKE TAPPER: But you're invoking his race when talking about whether or not...

DONALD TRUMP: Here's what I'm (INAUDIBLE)...

JAKE TAPPER: -- he can do his job.

DONALD TRUMP: Jake, I'm building a wall, OK?

I'm building a wall. I'm trying to keep business out of Mexico. Mexico is fine. There's nothing...

JAKE TAPPER: But he's American. He's an American.

DONALD TRUMP: -- the Mexican -- he's of Mexican heritage and he's very proud of it, as I am where I come from, my parents.

JAKE TAPPER: But he's an American. You keep talking about...

DONALD TRUMP: Jake...

JAKE TAPPER: -- it's a conflict of interest...

DONALD TRUMP: -- Jake, Jake...

JAKE TAPPER: -- because of Mexico.

DONALD TRUMP: Are you ready?

I have a case that should have been dismissed already. I have thousands of people saying Trump University is fantastic, OK?

I have a case that should have been dismissed. I have a judge that never ever gives a (INAUDIBLE). Now, we lose the plaintiff he lets the plaintiff of the case out.

So why isn't he canceling the case?

So we thought we won the case.

JAKE TAPPER: So you disagree with his rulings...

DONALD TRUMP: No, no.

JAKE TAPPER: -- I totally understand that.

DONALD TRUMP: No. Not me.

JAKE TAPPER: But you're sa...

DONALD TRUMP: I've had lawyers come up to me and say you are being treated so unfairly, it's unbelievable.

JAKE TAPPER: Isn't...

DONALD TRUMP: You know the plaintiffs in the case have all said wonderful things about the school and they're suing.

You know why they're suing?

Because they want to get their money back.

JAKE TAPPER: I don't really want to litigate the case...

DONALD TRUMP: You have to...

JAKE TAPPER: -- of Trump University...

DONALD TRUMP: -- because if he was...

JAKE TAPPER: What a...

DONALD TRUMP: -- was giving me fair rulings, I wouldn't say that.

JAKE TAPPER: My question is...

DONALD TRUMP: But, Jake...

JAKE TAPPER: Yes?

DONALD TRUMP: -- if you were giving me fair rulings, I wouldn't be talking to this way. He's giving me horrible rulings...

JAKE TAPPER: But I don't care if you criticize him. That's fine. You can criticize every decision. What I'm saying is if you invoke his race as a reason why he can't do his job...

DONALD TRUMP: I think that's why he's doing it. But...

JAKE TAPPER: (INAUDIBLE).

DONALD TRUMP: I think that's why he's doing it.

JAKE TAPPER: When Hillary Clinton says it's a racist attack...

DONALD TRUMP: Hillary -- Hillary Clinton is a stiff. If Hillary Clinton becomes president...

JAKE TAPPER: But Paul Ryan today...

DONALD TRUMP: -- I mean...

JAKE TAPPER: -- Paul Ryan today said he -- he didn't care for the way that you were attacking this judge.

DONALD TRUMP: Look, I'm just telling you. Paul Ryan doesn't know the case. Here's the story.

JAKE TAPPER: Isn't it the definite...

DONALD TRUMP: I should have won this case on summary judgment. This is not a case -- this is a case I should have won on summary judgment. Do you know the law firm paid Hillary Clinton hundreds of thousands of dollars to make speeches?

Do you know the law firm has...

JAKE TAPPER: I do. And we've reported it.

DONALD TRUMP: Oh, you do?

JAKE TAPPER: We've re- we've reported it on my show.

DONALD TRUMP: OK.

JAKE TAPPER: In fact.

DONALD TRUMP: OK, good. Well, I'm glad. You're the only one. The law firm...

JAKE TAPPER: (INAUDIBLE)...

DONALD TRUMP: Wait a minute. The law firm paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to Hillary Clinton for speeches.

JAKE TAPPER: Before either of you were president -- were running for president...

DONALD TRUMP: She wasn't working. Everybody fell asleep during the speech.

JAKE TAPPER: Before either of you were running for president, they did.

But here's the -- just the fundamental question.

DONALD TRUMP: Do you know that they've contributed tremendous amounts of money to her campaign?

JAKE TAPPER: Yes.

DONALD TRUMP: Do you know they've contributed a lot of money to Eric Schneiderman, the New York attorney general?

JAKE TAPPER: Here is my question.

DONALD TRUMP: No, no, do you know that?

JAKE TAPPER: I did not know that.

DONALD TRUMP: Do you know that these people went to every attorney general, practically, in the country that they could and do you know this case was turned down by almost every attorney general, from Texas to Florida to many of these states?

JAKE TAPPER: Is it not, when Hillary Clinton says this is a racist attack and you reject that, if you are saying he can't do his job because of his race, is that not the definition of racism?

DONALD TRUMP: No, I don't think so at all.

JAKE TAPPER: No?

DONALD TRUMP: No. He's proud of his heritage. I -- I respect him for that.

JAKE TAPPER: But you're saying he can't do his job because of that.

DONALD TRUMP: Look, he's proud of his heritage, OK. I'm building a wall. Now, I think I'm going to do very well with Hispanics.

JAKE TAPPER: He's a legal citizen...

DONALD TRUMP: You know why I'm going to do well with Hispanics?

Because I'm going to bring back jobs and they're going to get jobs right now. They're going to get jobs. I think I'm going to do very well with Hispanics.

But we're building a wall. He's a Mexican. We're building a wall between here and Mexico. The answer is, he is giving us very unfair rulings, rulings that people can't even believe. This case should have ended years ago on summary judgment. The best lawyers -- I have spoken to so many lawyers, they said this is not a case, this is a case that should have ended.

JAKE TAPPER: I have...

DONALD TRUMP: This judge is giving us unfair rulings.

Now I say why?

Well, I want to -- I'm building a wall, OK, and it's a wall between Mexico, not another country...

JAKE TAPPER: But he's not...

DONALD TRUMP: -- (INAUDIBLE).

JAKE TAPPER: -- he's not from Mexico.

DONALD TRUMP: In my opinion...

JAKE TAPPER: He's for Indiana.

DONALD TRUMP: -- he is -- his Mexican heritage. And he's very proud of it.

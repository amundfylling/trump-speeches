DONALD TRUMP: Record rates of immigration have produced lower wages and higher unemployment for U.S. workers. Pew polling shows 83 percent of all voters -- Democrats, Republicans and Independents -- think immigration should be frozen or reduced. The biggest beneficiaries of allowing fewer foreign workers into our countrywould be minority workers, including all immigrants now living here, who are competing for jobs, benefits and community resources against record waves of foreign workers. Limiting job competition would reopen pathways to middle-class stability and shrink welfare rolls. In addition, it would relieve overcrowding in ourschools and hospitals that afflict our poorest communities. Yet, Senators Cruz and Rubio have led the charge for even higher immigration rates -- a policy supported by only 7 percent of the Republican electorate. When I am President we will listen to the people -- not the special interests -- and get immigration numbers under control, as the voters have demanded.

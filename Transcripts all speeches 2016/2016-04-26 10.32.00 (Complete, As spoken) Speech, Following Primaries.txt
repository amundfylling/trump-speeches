DONALD TRUMP: ... I said, now how are you going to pivot out of this (INAUDIBLE)? They said, don't worry about it. In other words, they're politicians, they can do it.

But I just want to thank everybody. This is a far bigger win than we even expected, all five. And that's something that's really -- that's really something.

(APPLAUSE)

And not only is it all five, it's all five, whether it's 60 or just about 60, and even I see one up there at 66 and 67. And you have to remember, and I say this all the time to the pundits, I love the pundits, but I say it all the time, there are three people. When you crack 60, as we did last week with our great city and our great state of New York, when you crack 60 with three people, that's very hard to do.

In fact, I think Chris can tell you, if you crack 60 with two people, that's called a massive landslide. But we have three.

And you know, some strange things have happened. Last night it was very strange when I watched this group get together. That was a strange moment.

I got a call at 11:00 and we talked and I said I think that's a good thing because it shows weakness, it shows ineffectiveness, it shows failing campaigns (INAUDIBLE) it's collusion. In business, they put you in jail for collusion; in politics, you're allowed to get away with it.

But it really is, it's a -- I thought it was a very weak signal. And the Republican Party needs something much different than that.

(APPLAUSE)

Thank you.

We'll be going to...

(APPLAUSE)

We'll be going to Indiana. I'll be leaving tomorrow afternoon for just a long stay. And it's a great state. I have many, many friends there.

And I have a coach, Bob Knight, the great Bobby Knight.

(APPLAUSE)

And we're going to be spending a lot of time with Bobby. And Bobby's an amazing guy. He's tough, he's sharp, he's smart and he wins, he knows how to win. And the people of Indiana love him. And Bobby's endorsed me.

And we're going to spend tomorrow night and I think the next day with Bobby, so it's going to be a lot of excitement and fun. That's called the gold standard for Indiana. I would say Bobby Knight has to be the gold standard. And we have so many other people that have endorsed us there, so that'll be great. So we'll be spending -- we'll start in the afternoon and we're going to be spending numerous days in Indiana and it's going to be something really, really special.

So I want to thank the media. The media's really covered me very fair for the last two hours.

(LAUGHTER)

No, they've been really very fair over the last few weeks. And you know, it's been amazing what's been happening. The crowds we've had are record-setting crowds, bigger than Bernie. But Bernie is second, I have to say. In fact, I suggested today, you probably saw, that the Democrats have treated Bernie very badly. And frankly, I think he should run as an independent. OK? I actually do. I actually do. I think they've treated him very badly.

And you know, the system is a bad system, whether it's their system or our system, you look at what goes on.

But you know, the best way to beat the system is have evenings like this where you get record-setting votes, where you get record- setting delegates.

(APPLAUSE)

I used the analogy of the boxer. You know, when the boxer knocks out the other boxer, you don't have to wait around for a decision. So that's what it is, and that's what happened tonight, that's what happened last week in New York, and that's really what's been happening throughout.

We have millions more votes, millions more than Cruz. We have millions more votes than Kasich. I mean, Kasich now, I guess he was one and 41, so now he's one and 46. Why is he here?

I can tell you that if you look Dr. Ben Carson did much better. He could have hung around and done very well.

If you look, Chris Christie did much better.

(APPLAUSE)

If you look, Marco Rubio did much better.

(APPLAUSE)

In fact, Marco Rubio right now has more delegates than, you know, Kasich. I mean, he's got more delegates. But so many others, I mean, they've actually done -- all they had to do was hang around, but they thought it was inappropriate and a lot of people don't like seeing it. It's like a spoiled person that just says I'm just staying for whatever reason. So Kasich.

And by the way, as soon as Kasich gets hit with the first negative ad, he's had none, bing, that's the end of that. You know, it's the only thing he can say.

And today we came up even against Hillary, but we will beat Hillary so easily.

(APPLAUSE)

And remember this, remember this, I was not going to run, according to everybody, and I ran. I was not going to sign Form A, which basically you sign your life away, and I signed Form A. And then everybody started saying, wow. And then we put in financials, the financials were phenomenal, a little bit like this evening, far better than even people thought, great financials.

I've built a great company with the help of my sons and my daughters and, I mean, with the help of my family, frankly. I mean, it's been great.

(APPLAUSE)

But we've built a great, great company, and that was good. And then everybody said again, well, he's just going to have a good time for a couple of weeks, he's enjoying it.

And very shortly, we went to number one over a three or four-week period and we've been there ever since. We've been number one ever since. And again, millions of more votes, hundreds of more delegates.

And I think this one is maybe the biggest of them all. I mean New York last week at almost 62 percent was incredible, far better than what people thought. They said if you could break 50, again, with three people it's very hard to break 50, we hit almost 62 percent, picked up so many delegates.

(APPLAUSE)

Last week we had 95 delegates in New York state, New York City, the whole thing added up to 95. We picked up almost every single one of them. It was an amazing victory.

But this one's a diverse victory. I mean, you go Rhode Island, then you go Maryland, then you go Connecticut, and you go Pennsylvania, and you go, I mean, the whole thing, Delaware, and every one of them was conclusive. And every state is so different, I mean, it's so different.

I think one of the greats was when you look at almost 50 percent in Massachusetts and almost 50 percent in the state of Alabama, now, that's pretty different, but we have all across the board. And I think we're going to do really well in Washington state. I think we're going to do amazingly well in Oregon and every place we're going to. I mean, we're going to be going, fighting hard, New Mexico, we're going to be fighting really hard.

And I think that Governor Kasich and Senator Cruz have really, really hurt themselves with a faulty deal that was defaulted on before they even started. Because Kasich said, well, what do you mean, aren't they going to vote for me in Indiana? Well I said, I thought they just made that deal.

So what it is is politicians, all talk, no action, they can't get it done and they certainly can't straighten out our country, because we're going to bring back jobs, we're going to take care of our military, we're going to be doing so many things.

(APPLAUSE)

And for me, especially over the last two weeks, because I traveled New York state and I went to Syracuse and Poughkeepsie and Rome, this Rome, our Rome, Rome, New York, as opposed to there's another Rome out there someplace. But we went to Rome, New York and we went to the island Bethpage.

And just every place we went, manufacturing down 40 and 45 percent and even more. And then we go to Pennsylvania and we see the same thing. You look at what's happening with steel and you look at what's happening in so many other industries.

And I get statisticians to give me numbers before I leave, all the time give me the numbers, and every single place I go is a disaster. Manufacturing down 40, 45, 55, 60 percent sometimes in a relatively short period of time. Our jobs are being sucked away from our country and we're not going to let it happen anymore, folks. We're going to make it very, very difficult to do that.

And when companies want to leave this country, our great country, and they want to lay off all of these people that in many cases helped build the country, there will be consequences for that company to pay. When they think they're going to make their product and send it in, no taxes, through a very weak border -- which, by the way, our border will be very, very strong and we will build the wall. Just remember I said it, OK?

(APPLAUSE)

But when they think they're going to send their product right through this weak border and they're going to pay no tax and have absolutely no consequence for what they did, it's not going to happen that way.

And you know what's going to happen? When we do that, all of a sudden companies are going to say I'm staying in Syracuse and I'm staying in Pennsylvania and I'm staying in Maryland.

And I want to thank the people of Maryland. They've been so incredible. We have some rallies all over, but we had some rallies in Maryland and Pennsylvania that were absolutely unbelievable.

Yesterday in Pennsylvania we were in an arena that was like Madison Square Garden. They turned away thousands and thousands of people. Unfortunately, the press never reports that. They always show my face. They go like this. I said, does anybody ever want to show this arena that's got tens of thousands of people in it? But they don't do that. But that's OK because I'll at least explain it to you. But we're going to have our country back. We're going to make America great again. And I just want to tell you for the five states I am so honored. This was, to me, our biggest night because it shows such diversity.

(APPLAUSE)

So thank you very much. And we will take some questions.

Yes, CBS.

UNIDENTIFIED: (OFF-MIKE)

DONALD TRUMP: Yeah, it's all been -- well, I don't know the final numbers, but the money we're (INAUDIBLE) and we're looking for some other really worthy places to INAUDIBLE. But for the most part, yeah, for the most part it has been distributed. We raised millions of dollars.

Yes, go ahead.

UNIDENTIFIED: (OFF-MIKE)

DONALD TRUMP: I consider myself the presumptive nominee, absolutely. I mean, (INAUDIBLE).

(APPLAUSE)

I mean, honestly, Senator Cruz and Governor Kasich should really get out of the race. They have no pathway ever. They have no pathway.

(APPLAUSE)

And honestly, they should get out of the race and we should heal the Republican Party, bring the Republican Party together. And I'm a unifier. I unify people. That's how we did it in business. I mean, I unify people.

We will have people that are backing this party and backing my candidacy that you folks would not even believe. We're going to have such unity.

Now, I'm not saying everybody because some people have gone too far over the edge. But we will have people backing the party and backing the presidency. And we're going to win and we're going to beat Hillary Clinton and it's not even (INAUDIBLE).

(APPLAUSE)

Thank you.

UNIDENTIFIED: (OFF-MIKE)

DONALD TRUMP: Well, look, let me give you an example and it's really a (INAUDIBLE) question. And of course, we look at different things and I don't want to do that. And we're leading by so much and I think we're going to hit the numbers pretty easily. Most people agree with that. And probably before we end the process INAUDIBLE convention and INAUDIBLE. And we're INAUDIBLE. And I don't think that will INAUDIBLE.

I mean, if you look at Pennsylvania, first of all, they have (INAUDIBLE) tremendous leader.

And one of the things with Pennsylvania. You know, we had a massive victory, 60 percent, above 60 percent. Pennsylvania has been amazing.

(APPLAUSE)

We get 17 delegates outright. And then you have 54-or-so delegates that are, you know, up for grabs. The one thing different with Pennsylvania and I've been hearing about it, I've heard about it for years actually, is that the winner of Pennsylvania, there's a moral obligation, at least on the first round, to support the person that won.

Now, we didn't only win, we won big. And again, we have to get in mind you have the three people. And when you have three people, to get 60 percent that's almost unheard of. Honestly, if you had two people and you got 60 percent that's a really big victory.

So here you have a case where we have a great leader, a great Republican leader, and you have a moral obligation in Pennsylvania that those people will -- and all I care about is the first round.

You know, when you people write about Cruz is going around giving people dinner, buying people everything, riding them around all over the place, getting them into hotel rooms because he's looking for the second and the third and the fourth, I'm not really too interested in that because we're going to win on the first. I'm not looking to go second, third, fourth. But maybe I'm making a mistake.

I mean, the truth is, even if this did ever go there, can you imagine if Donald Trump -- because in California we're up to almost 50 percent, I think we hit 50 today and they're at 18 and 16, I mean, there's a massive difference. So we're going to have a big California.

I think we're going to do great in Indiana. Indiana is the home of Carrier air conditioning which is leaving for Mexico, that I've been talking about for the last four months, long before I knew Indiana would be so important. And I'm saying that won't happen if I'm president. Carrier will not be leaving Indiana if I'm president. But I've been talking about this for a long period of time.

So when you think of it and the really unfair thing that the pundits never report, when I began the process we had 17 people, very capable people like Chris, governors, senators, Dr. Ben Carson, very smart, tough, highly accomplished people, 17, a record in the history of politics, 17 people. So I go and I start winning. And I'll win New Hampshire and I'll get whatever it may be 32 percent. And people would say, why didn't he get 50 percent? I said you can't get 50 percent when you have 16 people.

Then I go to South Carolina, we have a massive victory. That was Cruz's stronghold, except I won it in a landslide and I won it because of the evangelicals who back me. The evangelicals have been unbelievable and they back me. So I won there.

And we had 12 or 13 or 14 people, we had many, many people, and I got a lot.

And then we went to Nevada, we went to the South, we went -- I mean, Alabama, with all the people we had, we almost got 50 percent. Massachusetts, with all of the people we had, we almost got 50 percent.

The pundits, I was watching tonight, the pundits never talk about the fact that these early states, especially even now we have three, three is unfair, you know, Hillary has one, I have three. There's a big difference. There's a big difference between fighting one person and fighting two people in terms of percentages.

So what I'm saying is when you talk about the 1,237 number, the first 70 percent of these things we had from 16 people and even 17 people to 10 to eight to six to five to four and now we're at three. So it's really unfair when you try and -- I mean, I've always been very good at math. Nobody ever discusses that.

When I watch the people on television, whether it's CNN, FOX or any of them, and I watch, they never talk about the fact that we have all these people and that if you got a 32 or a 35 or a 38 and you have seven people running, that's like 75.

So we are really honored by this night and I'm really honored to have hit over 60 in virtually every race with three people in the race. OK.

(APPLAUSE)

Go ahead, Tom.

I didn't want to bore you with that long, long, but I'm telling you, it's never discussed on television.

Go ahead.

UNIDENTIFIED: (OFF-MIKE) Just this week, Senator Cruz announced he's come up with a short list of potential running mates, he's started the vetting process.

DONALD TRUMP: He's wasting his time, Tom.

(LAUGHTER)

(APPLAUSE)

List of running mates? In fact, I heard he had a news conference tonight and I heard the news conference was for the purpose that he's getting out of the race. That's what I thought. And instead he just had a news conference, more talk. You know, but...

UNIDENTIFIED: Have you come up with a short list?

DONALD TRUMP: No, I don't want to even think about it right now. I'm not doing that. We're going to set up a committee at some point in the not-too-distant future. But I just don't want to think about it right now.

I want to finish it off...

UNIDENTIFIED: Would Governor Christie be on your list of names that you're...

DONALD TRUMP: Well, I think he's fantastic. Look, I think Chris Christie is fantastic. So certainly, he would be somebody.

(APPLAUSE)

UNIDENTIFIED: (OFF-MIKE) playing a part and that your...

DONALD TRUMP: No, I am me. You know, it's interesting, Sarah. I hear that, you know, he'll be presidential, he'll be not presidential, he'll do this. It's very easy to be presidential, by the way, much easier. But I'm not playing a part.

Look, I started off at 17, I'm down, now I'm winning and it's over. As far as I'm concerned, it's over, these two guys cannot win, there's no path. So why would I change?

You know, if you have a football team and you're winning and then you get to the Super Bowl, you don't change your quarterback, right? So I'm not changing.

UNIDENTIFIED: (OFF-MIKE)

DONALD TRUMP: I think we're going to do great in the general. Well, I may act differently, but my thought process is the same. You know, when I speak to a group of 10 people in a conference room, I'm not going to be speaking the same way I spoke in Pennsylvania yesterday to 25,000 people. It's a very different thing, but I'll be saying very similar things.

Yes, go ahead.

UNIDENTIFIED: (OFF-MIKE)

DONALD TRUMP: I'm doing a foreign policy speech, yes. Yeah, which I look forward to.

UNIDENTIFIED: (OFF-MIKE) Are you concerned to some extent that you lose your more enthusiastic, long-term supporters INAUDIBLE?

DONALD TRUMP: Well, it's an interesting question. I've had many, many people write in, tweet in, modern way of writing, but write in, tweet in, call in, please don't change, please don't change, just stay the way you are.

So, look, I'm not changing. You know, I went to the best schools, I'm, like, a very smart person, I'm going to represent our country with dignity and very well.

(APPLAUSE)

But I don't want to really change my personality. I think, you know, it got me here. Somebody said, if you changed and you were that way you wouldn't be maybe where you are right now, you know.

We beat a lot of people, a lot of people are sitting back saying, what happened, darling, why are we sitting here? We're watching television.

Don't forget, when I announced, there were many favorites that were going to win. One of those people raised over a hundred million dollars in a PAC and a lot of money personally. Others had other big advantages, governors of major states, etcetera, etcetera. They were all going to do great. They were all going to do great.

But one after another after another and here we stand with five victories over 60 percent.

David?

UNIDENTIFIED: Tonight in her speech, Hillary Clinton took a chunk out of you and basically said she's going to have a (INAUDIBLE). How do you fight back against someone that calls you a hateful person?

DONALD TRUMP: Look, sure, I mean, Hillary, I call her Crooked Hillary. She's crooked. She'll be a horrible president. She knows nothing about job creation. Her husband signed NAFTA which destroyed this country economically, I will tell you. You look at New York state, you look all over New England, you look at Pennsylvania, NAFTA was a disaster. Her husband signed it and it was a disaster for this country.

Hillary will be horrible, absolutely horrible on economic development. She will terrible on jobs. She knows nothing about jobs except for jobs for herself.

(APPLAUSE)

And when it came to answering the phone at 3:00 in the morning, she was sleeping, OK? She wasn't with Benghazi and all of the other problems. You look at what she did with Syria. You look at what she's done in so many different ways.

She will not be a good president. She doesn't have the strength, she doesn't have the stamina. I know about dealing with China. I've made billions of dollars dealing with China. China can be dealt with and you can get along with them. But Hillary does not have the strength or the stamina to deal with China or other things.

But bottom line is one of the big problems our country has is problems with trade where you have China, Japan, Mexico, so many countries just ripping us left and right.

The politicians cannot handle that problem. Two reasons: Number one, they don't have the competence to do it; number two, most of them are paid off through campaign contributions so that they don't touch certain things that the people want touched.

When people are making less money in real wages than they were 18 years ago and then some people say, wow, he had a big crowd, that's one of the big reasons. When you have people making less money today, as you know because you see every stat, less money today, David, than they made 18 years ago, and in some cases they're working two jobs. So they're getting older and they're working harder, it shouldn't be that way.

UNIDENTIFIED: You're not worried, although, about being labeled or...

DONALD TRUMP: No, I don't worry about it. No, no, I don't worry. I'm not a hateful person. I'm a person that loves people. And make America great again...

(APPLAUSE)

I mean, that's just a theme. I mean, she's going with that because she thinks it's great. I'll do far more for women than Hillary Clinton will ever do...

(APPLAUSE)

... including, remember this, including protecting our country because she will not be good with the military, she will not be good with protecting our country. And she's had her shot.

And she also raised her hand when it came to Iraq and she shouldn't have voted.

And if you remember, just take a look at the things that Bernie Sanders was saying about Hillary Clinton. He said she's not qualified to be president. But he said something else that -- was qualified, what's qualified? I mean, you've got to go out, you've got to run and you see what happens.

But he said some things about her that were so incredible, incredible and so incredibly bad. There's a great level of hatred right there, but he's been telling the truth. And I really mean it. I think Bernie Sanders should run as an independent. I think he'd do great. OK.

UNIDENTIFIED: Mr. Trump, you've just described yourself as the presumptive nominee. Is there a level of frustration that the party isn't seeing you that way, even after a win like tonight?

DONALD TRUMP: I think the party is seeing me that way. I'm getting calls that, as I said, you wouldn't believe. I'm getting calls from people that I really can't even know how they can do it because they've said such horrible things about me and now they want to join the team.

Chris can tell you that. Ben Carson can tell you that. Other people can tell you that. I'm getting calls, Corey can tell you, Paul can tell you.

We have -- we're getting calls from people who actually say, how can you do this, how can you do this, how can you do it? And they have no problem.

But the fact is names that you wouldn't believe. Names that you interview and say, oh, Trump, Trump, Trump and now they're calling, they want to join the team.

UNIDENTIFIED: When do you expect them to come out and...

DONALD TRUMP: Oh, a lot of them will be coming out soon, they want to come out very soon.

Yes?

UNIDENTIFIED: Thank you very much. To your foreign policy speech tomorrow, first of all, (INAUDIBLE) hoping to accomplish with this speech? And also, can you give us all a little bit of the preview about the INAUDIBLE issues that you'll...

DONALD TRUMP: Sure. I mean, tomorrow's going to be, I think, interesting. It's going to be some of my views on foreign policy and defense and lots of other things. So we'll be discussing, and part of it is the economics.

I mean, I was asked a question recently by Wolf Blitzer on CNN and he talked about NATO. I gave a great answer. I gave an answer that at first people didn't like, and then they said, you know what, Trump is right, experts said. I said it's obsolete and too many people are getting a free ride because we're funding 72, 73 percent of NATO.

You have 28 countries and many of these countries are just taking advantage of the United States. And you have to pay up because we don't have a country with $19 trillion in debt that can afford this anymore. You have to pay up.

And part of what I'm saying is people...

(APPLAUSE)

We love our countries and we love our allies, but our allies can no longer be taking advantage of this country. This isn't 40 years ago and it's not 20 years ago. This is now.

And we have to rebuild our infrastructure, we have to rebuild our country, we have to get rid of ISIS and we have to get rid of them fast.

Our military is totally depleted. We have to build it up. It's going to be the cheapest thing we can do.

And a lot of great things are going to happen. We're going to make America great again.

UNIDENTIFIED: That sounds a lot like what you talk about when you're on the stump at your rallies. Should we expect a lot of that or...

DONALD TRUMP: No, no, you're going to really hear different things. Yeah. I'll never change one thing. You know what I will never change? Make America great again, I will never change. That's one thing.

(APPLAUSE)

UNIDENTIFIED: (OFF-MIKE)

DONALD TRUMP: No, it's not going to be the Trump doctrine. And you know, when I say it won't be the Trump doctrine because in life you have to be flexible, you have to have flexibility, you have to change. You know, you may say one thing and then the following year you want to change it because circumstances are different.

And I've followed people for years and I have friends that are the most successful people in the world. Many of them are endorsing me, Carl Icahn, many of the great business people are endorsing me.

You have to have flexibility. You can't say this is my doctrine, I will not move, because the world changes, countries change, leaders change, lots of things happen. So you can't say that.

OK, yes, sir, go ahead.

UNIDENTIFIED: Mr. Trump, when you talked about winning in the last few races, talking about the ceiling that you had, you've definitely gone through that...

DONALD TRUMP: We don't have a ceiling. You know what our ceiling is? I think it's a hundred percent. We don't have a ceiling.

(APPLAUSE)

And again, the ceiling was always so unfair because I'm going to just do it again because I want to do it because it's so important.

UNIDENTIFIED: (INAUDIBLE)

DONALD TRUMP: But the ceiling -- wait a minute. The ceiling, they kept saying he doesn't hit the 50 percent. Well, now they don't say that anymore. But how do you hit 50 percent when you have 16 people in a race? You can't do it.

UNIDENTIFIED: Yeah, but we're talking about if just here in the Northeast, New York, Pennsylvania, these are places...

DONALD TRUMP: No, no, you don't understand. I have many people running.

UNIDENTIFIED: How are you going to win these states...

DONALD TRUMP: I think I'm going to win New York, no other Republican can say it. I think I'm going to win...

UNIDENTIFIED: (INAUDIBLE)

DONALD TRUMP: Excuse me, conservative voters? Did you see the polls where they're coming out tonight? The most conservative people in the Republican Party tonight back Donald Trump, the most conservative, OK? The most. You've got to see the polls.

(APPLAUSE)

Go ahead.

UNIDENTIFIED: (OFF-MIKE)

DONALD TRUMP: That is the single-biggest question I'm getting, student debt. And we're going to work on that and we're going to make it much different.

The biggest problem the students have, they have the problem with debt, but they go to a good college, they borrow right up to here and they're choking on debt. And they graduate and they work hard, they get good marks and then they can't get a job.

I'm going to bring jobs back to this country like you've never seen. That's the biggest problem.

(APPLAUSE)

UNIDENTIFIED: (OFF-MIKE) What is the biggest contrast in terms of how INAUDIBLE Wall Street and the economy between you and Secretary Clinton?

DONALD TRUMP: Well, we have a lot of contrasts in terms of jobs. We have a lot of contrasts in terms of how I would handle Wall Street.

Look, Hillary Clinton is funded by Wall Street, folks. I mean, she's going to get the nomination unless she gets herself indicted with respect to what's happening with the emails, OK? You know, what I don't understand, you look at what's happened to so many other people and they're, you know, they went through hell, their lives have been destroyed for doing less than what Hillary Clinton did. What she did is an outrage, it's an absolute criminal outrage.

And for her to be able to run as a Democrat, that's why maybe Bernie Sanders isn't finished. But the only way you can say that is if something happens to her. She's being protected by the Democrats. Because what she did, and I see it, and whether I read about it in the papers or I watch it with experts, legal experts on television, virtually every single one of them said what she did is a criminal act and what she did is a very, very dangerous thing for our country.

And yet, here she is running for president. So I think that Hillary, honestly, she's a flawed candidate and I think she's going to be easy to be. I think she's going to be much easier to beat than most of the 16 people that I competed with just recently.

(APPLAUSE)

Go ahead.

UNIDENTIFIED: (OFF-MIKE) If you become president, what's the number- one security threat to this country and how would you deal with it?

DONALD TRUMP: To me, always the number-one security threat to the United States is nuclear. That's our biggest threat, it's our biggest risk, the power of weaponry. And we have to be unbelievably careful.

The single big -- it is not global warming. President Obama said the biggest threat to our country is global warming. That's called give me a break, OK?

The biggest threat to our country is nuclear and we cannot let Iran get a nuclear weapon.

(APPLAUSE)

We're going to do something where we'll have a real partnership with China. You know, we have a lot of power over China. China has rebuilt itself by making a fortune over us.

China has power, tremendous power over North Korea. We have to be very vigilant on North Korea. We cannot let this guy go much further. And China should handle that problem. China can handle that problem very easily. They say they can't, but they're toying with us, OK? They're toying with us.

We have a lot of power. We're going to have a great relationship with China. We're going to have a great relationship with Putin and Russia.

But let me tell you, China has a lot of power over North Korea, a tremendous amount of power, they just refuse to use it and they refuse to talk about it. And they're toying with us.

And right now they don't respect us, they don't respect our president. And because of that, they're getting away with murder and this guy is getting away with murder.

What's going to happen is, and something very important to me and to a lot of other people, but very, very important to me is nuclear weaponry, that is your single-biggest threat in the world today. Go ahead, Tom.

UNIDENTIFIED: Are you worried at all that you can possibly be going for president in November and also standing trial for Trump University?

DONALD TRUMP: No, that's a civil case, very simple. I'm going to win that case very easily.

Yeah, go ahead.

UNIDENTIFIED: (INAUDIBLE) politics behind...

DONALD TRUMP: Go ahead, Sarah. Go ahead.

UNIDENTIFIED: (OFF-MIKE) Mr. Trump, Hillary Clinton INAUDIBLE just had INAUDIBLE...

DONALD TRUMP: Well, my unfavorables have come down a lot over the last few weeks.

UNIDENTIFIED: (OFF-MIKE) How do you change that...

DONALD TRUMP: Well, remember this. OK. I saw it on all of the cable stations and a lot of the networks and I read it in a lot of papers. I've had 55,000 negative ads against me.

When I ran in Florida, I had 14,000 negative ads, millions and millions of dollars, and I won in a landslide. I've had negative ads all throughout and I've won races in a landslide, OK, in a landslide. You know it, you report it, you all report it. I'm not -- even Carl would agree to that, right? I mean, landslides.

And yet, I have this tremendous amount of -- you almost say, do ads mean anything? I think we're going to hurt the industry pretty much because people are going to say, what does an ad mean? But I've had -- now, largely the ads were false, a little truth to some of them perhaps, but largely false.

But I had 55,000, a hundred million, and even more negative ads. Even in New Hampshire, I mean, Jeb spent millions and millions of dollars on negative ads and I won New Hampshire in a landslide.

UNIDENTIFIED: (OFF-MIKE)

DONALD TRUMP: No, no. But now what's happening is most of these people that have been fighting me are gone. And when I'm one-on-one with Hillary, she will be, as I said, easier to take down, much easier to beat than the people, many of the people that I've already beaten.

OK.

UNIDENTIFIED: (OFF-MIKE)

DONALD TRUMP: Well, I think they're hurting the party because, again, they have no path, zero path to victory. And we're going to win on the first ballot. We don't look for the delegates on number two, three, four, five ballot.

And here's what I say. Let's assume it did go beyond the first ballot and let's assume you're Reince, who's a very good man, head of RNC, Reince Priebus, and let's say, oh, well, Trump was 12 short or 15 delegates short or 25 short, but 500 more than Cruz and far more than that ahead of Kasich.

So you go to a second ballot. Now, Trump by that time will be 5 million votes because of California and the size of California and I think Indiana and other places. Trump by that time will be 5 million votes ahead of Cruz, will be much more than 5 million votes ahead of Kasich. I mean, Kasich should be -- he ought to get -- I call him -- now I change it, now I change it to one in 46. I mean, how do you stay in a race?

And I would have won Ohio had I not been given a dirty poll saying that Florida was tougher than I thought. I stayed in Florida for two more days instead of going to Ohio. If I had spent two more days in Ohio I would have won it. OK?

How do you pick a man on the second or third or fourth ballot who has millions of votes, 5 million, 6 million votes less than Trump, and I'm the one that brought all these people into the party? That's why the Republican Party is up almost 70 percent from four years ago.

(APPLAUSE)

And you know what's going to happen? Those people, at a minimum they're going to be very upset, very angry. But at a minimum they're just not going to vote, they're not going to vote.

So how do you do this? How do you say, OK, Trump won by 5 million votes, Trump is 500, 600, whatever-hundred delegates more than Cruz and much more than that having to do with Kasich, and he brought millions of people into the party and everybody is talking about the party worldwide how the Republican Party -- you know, some people used to say it stayed. Well, the Democrats are 35 percent down from four years ago. The Republicans are almost 70 percent up from four years ago. So, I mean, that's an amazing tribute.

(APPLAUSE)

And that's not because of, believe me, that's not because of Kasich or Cruz. That's because of me.

So here's the thing. How do you say to them, we're going to choose a man that lost by 5 million votes and 500 delegates, we're going to take him because Trump was 14 delegates short of winning on the first ballot? I don't think you can do that.

Now, with that being said, I intend to get enough delegates. But that's it.

OK, yes, ma 'am, one more question. Go ahead.

UNIDENTIFIED: (OFF-MIKE)

DONALD TRUMP: I'll stick with my feelings on immigration. If you look at what's going on with immigration and just look at the record numbers of people right now that are pouring across the borders of this country...

UNIDENTIFIED: (OFF-MIKE)

DONALD TRUMP: ... they're pouring -- excuse me, excuse me. I just read it and I read it in actually a legitimate journal, all right.

We need protection in our country. You look at the kind of crime, you look at what's going on economically, we need borders.

And by the way, I want people to come into our country, but I want them to come in legally. They have to come in through a process.

(APPLAUSE)

All right, we'll do one more.

UNIDENTIFIED: (OFF-MIKE)

DONALD TRUMP: Excuse me?

UNIDENTIFIED: (OFF-MIKE) You said that Hillary Clinton is playing the woman card. How exactly is she doing that?

DONALD TRUMP: Well, I think the only card she has is the woman's card. She's got nothing else going. And frankly, if Hillary Clinton were a man I don't think she'd get 5 percent of the vote. The only thing she's got going is the woman's card.

And the beautiful thing is women don't like her. OK? And look how well I did with women tonight. OK.

(APPLAUSE)

So ladies and gentlemen, thank you, thank you very much. I appreciate it. Thank you.

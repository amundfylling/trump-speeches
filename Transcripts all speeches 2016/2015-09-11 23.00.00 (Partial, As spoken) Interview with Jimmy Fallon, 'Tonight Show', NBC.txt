JIMMY FALLON: What are you doing that they are not doing?

DONALD TRUMP: I think they want our country to be respected again. I think they feel that if I'm president, I will do some great things for our country and we're going to be respected again. We're not scuffed at and we're not going to be laughed at, we're not going to make bad deals, we're going to make great deals and I think they feel that I'll be able to do that and I know I'll be able to do that.

And that's why it's almost like a movement in Dallas. Mark Cuban called. He said he has the arena. I said, the arena -- this was like three or four days ago. In Dallas, we have a sold out arena in Dallas and it went up like a few days ago.

In Alabama, we went to Mobile, Alabama, we had 31,000 people in the stadium, and we started looking for a people like a few days before. In fact, we were going to a hotel for 500 people as a favor to a friend of mine and he said, "This is crazy." We then went to a convention center. That was 10,000 and then a stadium for 31,000.

So, there is a movement going on that is amazing to watch and it's beautiful to watch, the people love this country.

JIMMY FALLON: What the heck?

(APPLAUSE)

What question did I ask? I don't even know what it was!

DONALD TRUMP: Something.

JIMMY FALLON: Did I ask about stadiums? I don't know what the hell just happened.

STEPHEN COLBERT: This is the last time you ever have to address this question if you hit the ball. OK.

DONALD TRUMP: Go ahead.

STEPHEN COLBERT: There is like sauce all over my hand. This meatball is so good.

DONALD TRUMP: I want to hear this.

STEPHEN COLBERT: Barack Obama born in the United States, was he? It's a meatball. It's hanging out there. Right there. Come on.

DONALD TRUMP: You want to know, I don't talk about it anymore. I talk about jobs. I talk about our veterans being horribly treated. I just don't discuss it.

STEPHEN COLBERT: You know, that meatball is being dragged down the steps of the subway by a rat.

(CROSSTALK)

You missed the meatball.

(CROSSTALK)

DONALD TRUMP: I talk about jobs. I'm talking about the vets who are treated like third class citizens. They are treated worse than the illegals. The vets of this country are so mistreated terribly. I am talking about the military building. Those are the things I'm talking about. I'm not talking about that.

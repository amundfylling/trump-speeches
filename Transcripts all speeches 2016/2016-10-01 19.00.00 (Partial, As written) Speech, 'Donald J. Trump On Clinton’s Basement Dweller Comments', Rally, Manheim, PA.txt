DONALD TRUMP: A new audio tape that has surfaced from another one of Hillary's high-dollar fundraisers shows her demeaning and mocking Bernie Sanders supporters.

In the tape, Hillary attacks Sanders supporters as living in their parents basements, and trapped in dead-end careers. She describes many of them as ignorant, that they want the United States to be more like Scandinavia but that half the people don't know what that means.

To sum up, Hillary Clinton thinks Bernie supporters are hopeless and ignorant basement dwellers.

Then, of course, she thinks people who vote for Trump are deplorable and irredeemable.

And lets not forget, at the recent debate, Hillary Clinton all but said that most of the country is racist, including the men and women of law enforcement.

In short, if you are not a diehard Hillary Clinton supporter from Day One, Hillary Clinton thinks you are a defective human being.

How on earth can Hillary Clinton try to lead this country when she has nothing but contempt for the people who live in this country?

She slanders and attacks anyone who wants to put America First, whether they are Trump Voters or Bernie Voters.

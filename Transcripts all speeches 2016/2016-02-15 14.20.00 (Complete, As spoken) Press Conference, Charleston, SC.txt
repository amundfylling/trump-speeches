UNIDENTIFIED: Trump, Mr. Trump, why is there so much bad blood between you and the Bush family? Where did this start? Where did.

DONALD TRUMP: Well it only has to do with me. Yeah.

UNIDENTIFIED: often said that -- you said that you don't attack first..

DONALD TRUMP: That's true, well.

UNIDENTIFIED: What happened?

DONALD TRUMP: OK. It's very fair question. There's no bad blood. Jeb Bush has spent about $20 million on negative ads that in many cases are false, but they're negative ads. He's got a lot of special interest money. His campaign, in my opinion, is going absolutely nowhere. But he spent about $20 million on negative ads on me. And, in theory, he has a long way before he catches and he should be, you know, looking at some -- or go positive. I think he'd do better if he went positive. But the only reason is, and the only reason I bring it up is, we have to respond to those negative ads. So that's the reason. No bad blood.

UNIDENTIFIED: What about George W. Bush? He's never attacked you and you've attacked him relentlessly.

DONALD TRUMP: No, I just -- I just said facts. No, no. But once he entered the fray, like Bill Clinton three weeks ago entered the fray, and I helped Bernie Sanders much more than he helped himself, believe me, because if you look at it, that's when she started going down and that's when that race started getting competitive. So you just take a look. You study your numbers and study your dates. When she attacked me, I attacked her and that's when Hillary started going down and that race became much more competitive. Take a look. You'll be very interested to see. Only one political reporter got that one.

Yes.

UNIDENTIFIED: Yes, Mr. Trump, you're honest about George W. Bush and 9/11. Ted Cruz said today (INAUDIBLE) you were taking --

DONALD TRUMP: Well, Ted Cruz is desperate. Look, he's a --

UNIDENTIFIED: (INAUDIBLE) the left.

DONALD TRUMP: Yes, I think Ted's a very unstable guy. We put out a little release. I think you probably get it. Did you get the release, John? I think he's a very unstable guy. And I must tell you one thing about Ted Cruz, that I can say that only to a minor extent by comparison for the other politicians, I haven't been doing this long. I'm been in it since June 16th. I will tell you, I have never ever met a person that lies more than Ted Cruz. I have never, ever seen anything like it.

He did it with Ben Carson. He did it with the voter violation fraud deal that he did. I mean it was a fraud. His voter violation fraud, which you guys really didn't pick up, which was very interesting. You picked up the Ben Carson thing very much, where he told people that Ben Carson had left the race, he's out of the race. And now they have calls that are much more severe than anything you had at the time. But that Ben Carson had left the race, come vote for Ted Cruz, which actually had an impact on me because they would have been, you know, would have been probably a victory for Trump, but it doesn't matter.

But I will tell you, the thing you didn't pick up on is the voter violation fraud that he committed. It was a fraud that he committed. And you take a look.

So -- but I've never seen anybody that lied as much as Ted Cruz. And he goes around saying he's a Christian. I don't know. You're going to have to really study that.

Yes?

UNIDENTIFIED: You said earlier today that Ted Cruz is unstable. What do you think --

DONALD TRUMP: I think he's unstable. No, I think he's an unstable person. I watch him. I see him. And I always say he's a good debater, but he can't talk. The guy literally -- he's a good debater. I don't even think he's a good debater. I mean I heard he's a good debater. I don't personally see he's a very good debater. But he is a very unstable person. And that's just my opinion.

UNIDENTIFIED: Too unstable to be president?

DONALD TRUMP: Yes. Yes, I would say that's true.

UNIDENTIFIED: Mr. Trump --

DONALD TRUMP: Yes.

UNIDENTIFIED: (INAUDIBLE) last event that President George W. Bush has gone silent for several years. Do you think President George W. Bush was a failed president?

DONALD TRUMP: I'm not going to say whether he was failed or not. He had some problems. Look, when somebody attacks me, like Jeb, at one of the debates, and I was very nice to him at the Ronald Reagan, I didn't say it, I didn't want to say it, but he talked about the tremendous safety. Well, excuse me, the World Trade Center came down during the, you know, reign of George Bush, right? I mean it came down.

So during the Ronald Reagan -- if you remember, the library debate, he mentioned about how we were safe. We weren't safe. That was the greatest attack in the history of the United States. Worse than Pearl Harbor, because it was individuals. We were attacked as individuals as opposed to the military. The greatest, single attack.

So what he's saying -- and I'm standing up there, I'm saying, do I want to embarrass him by saying this? But because I'm a nice person, I didn't do it. But then when he used it another time, I had to say, I'm sorry, but we weren't safe, the World Trade Center came down, which was the greatest attack in history on this country. So you had that.

You obviously had the war, which was a big mistake. I mean I think few people would say the war in Iraq was a positive. You had him on the aircraft carrier saying all sorts of wonderful things, how the war was essentially over. Guess what, not over. And, you know, the war with Iraq is a disaster.

Now Iran is taking over Iraq, as sure as you're sitting there. They're taking the oil. They're taking everything. I said take the oil. I was against the war in Iraq, by the way. I was the only one on the stage. Believe me, you should get some points for vision, but I was totally against the war in Iraq. I said it's going to destabilize the Middle East. And then when they went in, I said when they're getting out, take the oil. They didn't take the oil. So now Iran is going to have the oil and ISIS has the oil. And ISIS, this has fueled ISIS because ISIS now has so much money because they've had the oil.

So, yes, yes, go ahead.

UNIDENTIFIED: Mr. Trump, today you've attacked Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz. You've repeatedly said that you're a uniter. What do you say to --

DONALD TRUMP: Well, it is a political campaign. No, no, it is a political campaign. I mean am I allowed to attack? I get attacked. They're attacking me all the time. No, I'm not -- did I attack Marco? For what, joking? For being a joke artist? Where did I attack him? For being a joke artist?

UNIDENTIFIED: Sure.

DONALD TRUMP: And we can't have that as a president, can we? OK. I don't think I attacked Marco.

Yes, go ahead.

UNIDENTIFIED: Mr. Trump, (INAUDIBLE) --

DONALD TRUMP: Sorry. Thanks.

UNIDENTIFIED: Campaign ads, when you say to him, you say that if Ted Cruz doesn't take down his ads attacking you, you will sue him.

DONALD TRUMP: Yes, well, he's printed lies. He said I'm pro-choice and I'm pro-life. He's printed lies. I mean they're so -- not only printed. I mean I think he's taken out -- look, what he did with Ben Carson was terrible. I've never seen anything like that. It was a total lie.

And, by the way, 10 minutes after the election was over, the caucus, he went and said, oh, I'm sorry. He called Ben. And Ben didn't accept that apology the way I look at it, OK, didn't accept the apology.

So I don't want to be in a position where it's Saturday evening and I get a phone call from him, you know, I'm really sorry about that, my staff did something. He did three or four things. There's a -- for instance, he talks about me being against the Second Amendment. I am the strongest person running in favor of the Second Amendment. I'm a member of the NRA. My sons have been long-term members of the NRA and they're extraordinary shots. They, I mean, the whole thing is incredible.

So what he does is he'll walk up and he'll say something. He said, I will appoint liberal judges. Donald Trump -- I just saw it, Donald Trump is going to appoint liberal judges. I named two judges that are -- and I named them during the debate. I was the only one that named two judges that I would appoint. Those two judges -- now it could be somebody else, but those two judges are highly respective, conservative judges. They'd be great judges to appoint.

But he just gets up and says, if Donald Trump gets in, he's going to appoint liberal judges. Just the opposite. But the only way you can fight it and the only way I can fight it is all the press here. But most people can't fight it. But he's a liar. So he'll go up and he'll absolutely lie. In fact, Henry, who is lieutenant governor, said I can't believe the things he's saying, because he understands the views on everything and he just comes out and, boom, boom, boom, absolute lies.

Now, he'll apologize, but I don't want an apology after the election. I want the apology before. And if he doesn't, I'm going to bring a lawsuit because, in my opinion, based on what I've learned over the last two, three days from very top lawyers, he doesn't even have the right to serve as president or even run as president. He was born in Canada. So I will bring that lawsuit if he doesn't apologize.

UNIDENTIFIED: (INAUDIBLE) in terms of the ultimatum, what is your deadline by this point --

DONALD TRUMP: Oh, pretty quick. I do quick.

UNIDENTIFIED: (INAUDIBLE).

DONALD TRUMP: I -- maybe, if I can. Got to get the papers drawn. But it will be -- don't worry, we have another one coming up. OK, it will be pretty quick.

Yes. Oh, John, go ahead.

UNIDENTIFIED: (INAUDIBLE) today is attacking your sister --

DONALD TRUMP: Can you imagine, my sister?

UNIDENTIFIED: Yes. (INAUDIBLE).

DONALD TRUMP: By the way, my sister was appointed by Ronald Reagan. Elevated, elevated, I believe, in the Clinton administration. But she was appointed -- originally appointed by Ronald Reagan.

UNIDENTIFIED: Let me ask you this two part question. Are families on or off on this? And is this now a sign that this race is having really personal --

DONALD TRUMP: Well, I think --

UNIDENTIFIED: Political posturing --

DONALD TRUMP: I think, first of all, my sister has nothing to do with me. I mean she's a federal judge at a high, high level, court of appeals, and she was appointed by Ronald Reagan -- originally appointed by Ronald Reagan. A highly brilliant woman. Known as a great, you know, as a very brilliant judge.

I don't even know what her views are and I don't think she'd want to tell me. I think she's a very -- you know she doesn't -- I remember one of -- one of your cohorts wanted to do a great story about her. I said, listen, they want to do a great story about you. She said, I don't want any stories. She's very much like me in that respect. I don't know. I said, are you sure we have the same parents?

UNIDENTIFIED: OK. So are families -- and, again, (INAUDIBLE) --

DONALD TRUMP: I think, frankly, I mean, she's a federal judge, highly respected at every level by both sides, by everybody and I don't know that that's -- I mean certainly what he said about her is horrible. They, you know, they made her sound just terrible. She may have views on certain things. I'm never asked her her views. I don't want to ask her her views. I don't think it's appropriate. She is a very, very solid person and a very great intellect and she's acknowledged as being so on the court.

UNIDENTIFIED: OK, but has this now become really personal? It seems like the tenor of this campaign is now increasingly personal. There's no political --

DONALD TRUMP: Well, I think in many respects. But with -- with Cruz, more so, because even Jeb won't go and say like, you know, boom, he's -- Donald Trump is like against the Second Amendment or whatever. You know, I mean he -- he doesn't do that. What Cruz says is incredible. I've never seen anything like it. He just actually -- I think he actually said it. Donald Trump is against the Second Amendment. I said, what?

I did a radio show this morning with a very good host and I won't mention the name but you can figure it out, and he said, you know, he said that you were totally in favor of Obamacare. Now every single speech I've made has -- we have to repeal and replace Obamacare. So the host said, you know, he said this and I questioned him. He said, no, no, he really likes Obamacare. Now how do you fight that? Except that these people can fight it. Now, don't forget, I only have three days to fight it. I don't have, you know, like I'll do it over a period of six months.

So we will bring a lawsuit if he doesn't straighten his act out. He's a really lying guy, a really lying guy. Some people misrepresent. This guy's just a plain liar. In fact, I felt better because Marco Rubio called him a liar the other night on stage. I felt so much better. I said, good, a politician called a politician. Now I can actually call him a liar.

Let's go. Go ahead.

UNIDENTIFIED: (INAUDIBLE QUESTION)

DONALD TRUMP: This is a different reason. This is for Gitmo. And it's really originally for Gitmo, but you folks haven't asked that question yet, because it's ridiculous they're moving people in that area and we're totally against it. And if I win, we're moving them out. And they shouldn't be closing Gitmo, Guantanamo Bay. They shouldn't be closing it in any way, shape or form. And they shouldn't be moving people, hardened criminals into this area. I will stop it. If I don't stop it in terms of time, if I win, they're going back.

UNIDENTIFIED: (INAUDIBLE QUESTION)

DONALD TRUMP: I'd keep it open. Yeah, I'd keep it open. That's right, I'd keep it open. We have to be very vigilant. We'll look at everybody's case certainly. And you don't want to have people that are innocent of something, suffering. But you have some very hardened people. You've let a lot of people go. He's letting them go one after the other. Many are going back to the battlefields. You've seen what happened, they're going right back into the battlefields.

So we want to keep it open, and that's the way I feel. And I don't want -- and here's the thing. I don't want people coming into this area. And I've had such complaints. I've had people from South Carolina calling me asking me to do this press conference about Guantanamo Bay. And there's not going to be any people coming here. And frankly, I think the governor should take a very strong stand on it.

UNIDENTIFIED: (INAUDIBLE QUESTION)

DONALD TRUMP: Eventually, yeah, eventually. Eventually, they should. I would increase the population. As we capture other people that are terrorists and the like, I would absolutely increase. I would be very strong on it, yes.

UNIDENTIFIED: (INAUDIBLE QUESTION)

DONALD TRUMP: Well, the governor has a lot of people that people don't realize. A governor is -- for instance, with the migration, you have people coming into the area of South Carolina. They're coming in. If I were the governor, I wouldn't let them come in. I don't care what the rules and regulations say. In theory, the governor doesn't have anything to do with it. I would have something to do with it, believe me. I would make it so uncomfortable for the federal government that they'll say, OK, send them to other states or let's no take them in period. We shouldn't be taking people in from the migration. We shouldn't be taking people in from Syria, because we don't know who they are. We don't know where they come from. You look at what's going on in Sweden and Germany and all these other countries, we should not be taking people in from the migration.

Now, we should help people with safe zones in Syria. We should get -- I will get the Gulf States to pay for it, because right now they're paying for nothing and they're taking nobody. Because they're smart. You know what, they're smart. But they'll pay. And we're not going to pay. We'll lead it, but we should build safe zones because you have to do something. But I don't want to take people into this country. You saw what happened in California with two people that got married that were radicalized and it was a disaster, OK, a disaster. They killed 14. Plenty of people laying right now in the hospital. You look at what's going on right now in the world, we're not going to do it. We have enough problems as a country. You take a look at what's going on in Germany. Look at what's going on in Brussels. Look what's going on in Sweden the other night. We're not going to have that.

UNIDENTIFIED: (INAUDIBLE QUESTION)

DONALD TRUMP: I don't say anything. I'm just saying this, if you look back at your record, you'll see there was tremendous information and the CIA and various other agencies were not talking and they were not getting along and there were a lot of personality conflicts and they all hated each other and we ended up with the World Trade Center, OK. If you look at the book, "The America We Deserve, " written in the year 2000, I mentioned in that book -- me, I wrote it. I mentioned in that book "Osama bin Laden, " because I saw him a couple of times and I read about him, and I said, you know, he's a bad dude, we better do something about him.

Now, I wasn't even a politician. I wasn't in politics. I just always found it very interesting. I'm saying to myself, we better do something about that guy. Why wouldn't -- if you did something about him, you wouldn't have the World Trade Center come down. But if you look back at the CIA and the various other agencies -- and I think John is not nodding. I don't know if you remember it. But they had tremendous problems getting along together. That's management. Because if they did, they knew what was going -- they knew some bad things were going to happen. They could have stopped it.

(CROSSTALK)

Go ahead.

UNIDENTIFIED: (INAUDIBLE QUESTION)

DONALD TRUMP: I don't say it was anything. I just say the World -- I don't say anything. Here's what I say. Are you ready? The World Trade Center came down during his reign. So, you know, it's like he was the top. The World Trade Center came down.

UNIDENTIFIED: (INAUDIBLE QUESTION).

DONALD TRUMP: Well, the war with Iraq, which started this whole thing, the whole thing starts with the war in Iraq. You know, Saddam Hussein was a bad guy. One thing about him, he killed terrorists. Now Iraq is harbored for terrorism. You want to become a terrorist, you go to Iraq. Saddam Hussein understood, and he killed terrorists. Bad guy. But if the president and other people -- and, frankly, Obama, was no better, because the way he got us out was a disaster. Look what's happened since then. A disaster. Shouldn't have been there. Shouldn't have got out the way we got out. But if the president went to the beach, we would have been better off, believe me.

(CROSSTALK)

John, go ahead.

UNIDENTIFIED: (INAUDIBLE QUESTION)

DONALD TRUMP: No, I think we could have had greater vigilance but I would never say anybody is responsible for that.

UNIDENTIFIED: (INAUDIBLE QUESTION)

DONALD TRUMP: Say hello to him for me. Give him my warmest records regards.

UNIDENTIFIED: (INAUDIBLE QUESTION)

DONALD TRUMP: No, no, look, this is --

UNIDENTIFIED: (INAUDIBLE QUESTION)

DONALD TRUMP: Me? No. Look, look, look, actually, no. When was this set up, I have no idea. This was set up for Guantanamo. No, not really.

UNIDENTIFIED: (INAUDIBLE QUESTION)

DONALD TRUMP: I compare it to Bill Clinton. So Bill Clinton came out four weeks ago and his wife made a statement about me having to do with sexism, right. And I made a statement about her and him. And I said once she made that statement and once he was campaigning, it's a whole different ball game. Now, if the ex-president is campaigning for his brother, I think he's probably open to great scrutiny. Maybe things that haven't been thought of in the past. You know, when Jeb used his name, as I said in the first debate, in the Reagan debate, I left it alone. But when he kept using it, I said, I have to bring it up. When he talked about the great safety we had. I said, I'm sorry, at some point, we have to bring it up. The other day, I brought it up. I said the World Trade Center came down during your brother's reign.

UNIDENTIFIED: (INAUDIBLE QUESTION)

DONALD TRUMP: I don't think anything can hurt him. He's doing so badly, how much worse can he be hurt, you know?

(LAUGHTER)

UNIDENTIFIED: (INAUDIBLE QUESTION)

DONALD TRUMP: Delay, delay, yes.

UNIDENTIFIED: (INAUDIBLE QUESTION)

DONALD TRUMP: I wouldn't draw the line. Hey, I don't blame Obama. He's going to try to do it. I don't think he could be successful because Mitch McConnell has tremendous power in terms of the delay and in terms of, you know, proceedings, etcetera. The time is not that long. It's what, 11 months, 10 months. So it's not -- no, but it's not that much. I'm not saying that Obama shouldn't do it. I'm just saying the Republicans should not allow it to happen. Now, I also said the Republicans should not have approved the budget they approved four weeks ago, and they approached the budget. So you never know. I mean, they've been very disappointing. The Republicans have been very, very disappointing. I always say that Obama is the worst negotiator I've ever seen with everybody but the Republicans.

UNIDENTIFIED: (INAUDIBLE QUESTION)

DONALD TRUMP: I think what is going to happen is they'll put in somebody who is probably a little more moderate than he would have normally done. I still think the Republicans should reject. I think the new president should have that option.

(CROSSTALK)

Tom, go ahead.

UNIDENTIFIED: (INAUDIBLE QUESTION)

DONALD TRUMP: I'm not the first. I said from the beginning. I said from the beginning, Tom.

(CROSSTALK)

Tells me nothing about him, actually. I think the name Bush would have than an exclamation point. He's Jeb Bush. The exclamation point didn't work, so now he's using Bush. But I think he should have used his name. I think it shows he wasn't proud of the family. I don't know exactly what it tells you. I would tell him, why don't you use the name Bush? You're Bush. Use the name Bush.

UNIDENTIFIED: (INAUDIBLE QUESTION)

DONALD TRUMP: Oh, yeah. Look, if you look at the year -- you can play cute. Who are you, by the way?

UNIDENTIFIED: (INAUDIBLE QUESTION)

DONALD TRUMP: OK.

Let me tell you, Jim, you can play cute. In 2003 --

(CROSSTALK)

Excuse me. I'll tell you why it's cute, because I said many things for a long time, but I wasn't a politician so I didn't get any publicity by saying about it. I said for a long time don't go into the war, don't go into the war. I think the first time they have me down, you probably have it as 2003. This is shortly like right after the war started. Somebody actually said it doesn't make any difference because, early on, I said it. I was saying it before then, too. In 2003, right at the beginning, I said it, and very strongly. In 2004, I was in Reuters and quoted all over the place because I was opposed to the war. Very simple. I said you're going to destabilize the Middle East.

Right now, you have two powers, Iraq and Iran, equal in terms of military strength. If you knock out one of those powers, the other one will take over the Middle East. That's exactly what happened. Now I didn't know we'd be so stupid to make a deal where we give them $150 billion, which we just gave them. But now they have $150 billion. A very wonderful agreement with us in terms of -- you know they went out and they're spending their $150 billion.

So far they haven't spent any of it with us. They bought 118 aircraft from Air Bus, which is European. They're spending their money all over Europe. They're buying missiles from Russia. They're spending their money with everybody but the United States. Not good. Not good.

UNIDENTIFIED: (INAUDIBLE QUESTION)

DONALD TRUMP: Well, I'll tell you, I went to the debate and I was attacked. If I didn't -- if I wasn't attacked -- I thought it was my best debate. Some people agree. Some people thought I was too tough. I thought it was my best debate. But I was being attacked from everybody. It was the incoming. It was unbelievable. I was looking around. Including the moderator because they're saying Donald Trump said this and this about your brother. That's how the whole thing started. That Donald Trump said and, you know, in ancient times, so and so about your bother. I didn't bring it up. That was brought up by John as you know. So I didn't bring it up. So I was being attacked by the moderators from the standpoint that they were feeding -- it was like a feeding frenzy on Trump. That's why they got good ratings. They got very good ratings.

UNIDENTIFIED: (INAUDIBLE QUESTION)

DONALD TRUMP: I think I'm doing great in South Carolina. I think the South Carolina voters -- I know South Carolina very well. I've been here a lot. I think they have a very sophisticated voter. And they get it. They get it. For instance, when Cruz lies about virtually everything I've done, they get it. I really believe they get it. We'll soon find out.

UNIDENTIFIED: (INAUDIBLE QUESTION)

DONALD TRUMP: Well, actually, I'm doing a favor by filing. The Democrats are going to file it anyway. Just so you understand.

UNIDENTIFIED: (INAUDIBLE QUESTION)

DONALD TRUMP: You don't think I get along -- I get along with everybody. I was a business guy, got along with everybody. The Democrats -- if Cruz ever got it -- I don't think he's going to get the -- I think I'm going to get it. But if Cruz ever got the nomination, the Democrats are going to follow the lawsuit. In a sense, I'm doing him a favor because I'm filing it early. If I file it, I'm filing it early. But I have a very good lawyer, already hired. I have a very good lawyer and a lawyer that truly believes -- remember this, how do you give a man the nomination for your major party, one of the two major parties, and the man has a cloud over his head? And I told him, get a declaratory judgment. You've got to do something. The Democrats are going to file. To the best of my knowledge, there are already two lawsuits out there.

UNIDENTIFIED: (INAUDIBLE QUESTION)

DONALD TRUMP: No, no, no. Look, eventually, it's going to be used anyway. They're going to sue him. If he got the nomination -- they're not going to sue him now because they don't think he's going to get the nomination. But if he got the nomination, he's going to be sued. So frankly, if I were him, I'd probably tell him, if I was advising him, other than I'm more moral than he is, in my opinion, I would probably tell him very nicely, keep your lies going, you're going to get sued. You're going to get sued anyway, might as well keep your lies going. But let's see what happens. I think it's a good lawsuit.

UNIDENTIFIED: (INAUDIBLE QUESTION)

DONALD TRUMP: So am I.

UNIDENTIFIED: (INAUDIBLE QUESTION)

DONALD TRUMP: What does that mean he kept the country safe after 9/11? In other words, we had this major catastrophe and after that. What does that mean? I don't know. See, I've heard that for years. I've heard that for years, Jeremy. I've heard that for years he kept the country safe after 9/11. What does that mean, after? What about during 9/11? I was there. I lost a lot friends that were killed in that building. The worst attack ever in this country? It was during his presidency. We had the worse attack ever. By the way, after that, we did OK. That's meaning the team scored 19 runs in the first inning, but after that, we played well. I don't think so.

UNIDENTIFIED: (INAUDIBLE QUESTION)

DONALD TRUMP: Well, I don't know. I think we're doing well. I've been around. We have a tremendous rally tonight. I'm here for the entire week.

UNIDENTIFIED: (INAUDIBLE QUESTION)

DONALD TRUMP: You mean by the fact that I'm here? Give me a break.

UNIDENTIFIED: (INAUDIBLE QUESTION)

DONALD TRUMP: You have a situation here where people from Syria are being settled in South Carolina. And I think it's disgraceful. And if I were Nikki Haley, I would not allow it to happen, I tell you right now. I would not allow it to happen. She'll say we have no choice. A governor has choice, believe me.

UNIDENTIFIED: (INAUDIBLE QUESTION)

DONALD TRUMP: I don't know what you're talking about.

Go ahead.

UNIDENTIFIED: (INAUDIBLE QUESTION)

DONALD TRUMP: Well, I'm responding -- in all fairness, I'm responding.

UNIDENTIFIED: (INAUDIBLE QUESTION)

DONALD TRUMP: Me?

UNIDENTIFIED: (INAUDIBLE QUESTION)

DONALD TRUMP: I think I deal with pressure well. I've won many club championships. You have to deal with pressure. I deal with pressure. That's all I do. My whole life has been pressure. I like pressure. I really do like pressure.

But I don't think Cruz deals well with pressure. I think he's a basket case. He thought he was going to win New Hampshire and he lost. Not only did he lose, he lost badly. Does not handle pressure well.

I don't think Rubio handles pressure well. You saw that in his run-in with Christie. I was standing next to Rubio and I thought he just got out of a swimming pool. He was soaking wet. I don't think he handles pressure well. I don't see him negotiating -- look, I don't see that personality negotiating with Putin like this personality, OK. You want to make a good deal for the country, you want to deal with Russia -- and there's nothing wrong with not fighting everybody, having Russia where we have a good relationship as opposed to all the stupidity that's taken place. But I'm going to make the great trade deals. I'm going to make the great deals. These guys aren't going to make them. They're politicians.

UNIDENTIFIED: (INAUDIBLE QUESTION)

DONALD TRUMP: I think it's -- look, I think everything's a pressure cooker. You have to handle pressure. That's what I like doing. I love the pressure. But you can't lie. You can't allow lies to take place, like where Cruz is saying with guns, with Bush, and with this, and virtually everything. It's just a lie. Somebody has to say it.

I find the whole South Carolina thing so interesting. I find the people -- you know, we're already had a couple of events today. I find the people amazing. They're amazing.

The one thing that's really interesting, they're very knowledgeable politically in South Carolina. I think that's a good thing for me. They understand politicians. They understand they're all talk, no action. They're not going to make deals.

Look, I'm the only politician that's not getting any money. All these guys, like Cruz, getting tremendous money from oil and all these different -- Jeb Bush. Woody Johnson, from Johnson & Johnson, is his campaign, you know, finance chairman. Woody totally controls what happens. You think the drug industry is going to be hurt by Jeb Bush when Woody Johnson is the head of his committee raising funds for him? The drug comes, basically, there's no bidding. If we bid out -- we're the largest purchaser of drugs in the world that make you better. The largest in the world. The drug companies, there's no bidding. You know why there's no bidding? Because the politicians all take money from the drug moneys, campaign contributions. I don't know if you guys can figure that out. They take money from the drug companies. Same with everything.

Me, I'm not taking any money. I'll do what's right. I'll do what's right for the people. I will have spent a lot money by the time it's over. I don't know if that point is making made very importantly, John. Does somebody say "I love Trump because he's not taking money from the special interests or the lobbyists?" I don't know. But we'll soon find out.

UNIDENTIFIED: (INAUDIBLE QUESTION)

DONALD TRUMP: What?

UNIDENTIFIED: (INAUDIBLE QUESTION)

DONALD TRUMP: We're going to see. I'm going to look at a lot of things. What I see so far is unbelievable. That somebody can go and do what they're doing and make statements like that. Don't forget, I've been doing this since June 16th. I learned so much from Iowa. When somebody can be so dishonest. When I saw -- and I know you people covered the Ben Carson thing. But to me, what was worse was the "voter violation form." This thing looked like it was made -- came right out of the IRS. The paper, the look. It looked like a government document. It said "voter violation, you are in violation." So anyway, I'll be looking.

Yeah, go ahead.

UNIDENTIFIED: (INAUDIBLE QUESTION)

DONALD TRUMP: Very good reporter. By the way, very good reporter, this guy.

Go ahead.

UNIDENTIFIED: (INAUDIBLE QUESTION)

DONALD TRUMP: Well, they defaulted. Look, I'm very disappointed in the RNC. The Republican National Committee, right. I'm very disappointed in the RNC because, for three debates now, the room has been stacked with special interest and donors, as you know, as the press knows. As an example, I gave two judges who were very conservative judges -- I was met with nice applause, you know.

Bush got up and stumbled through an answer and the place went crazy. I said what are they doing? Then I realized all of these -- and many of the people -- I have to say, it's sort funny, but many of the people in the room I know. Some are friends to me. Some are waving and booing and they're having fun. I'm laughing. You know, I get it. But some of them are friends of mine. They're special interests, they're lobbyists, and that shouldn't be. They have total control over the people I'm running against. Total absolute control.

I bring up the drug thing because the drug companies are going to go to competitive bid. Whether we save $100 billion a year or $350 billion a year, they're going to competitive bid. These people can't say that, because the drug companies give them a fortune to run for office.

OK. Tom?

UNIDENTIFIED: (INAUDIBLE QUESTION)

DONALD TRUMP: Too many.

UNIDENTIFIED: (INAUDIBLE QUESTION)

DONALD TRUMP: Well, no, not the dirtiest. He's the biggest liar. I've seen some that are much more cunning because you wouldn't catch them. This guy lies but he got caught every time. He got caught with Carson. The good ones are ones who can do it and they don't get caught. If Ted Cruz did it and didn't get caught. He got caught with "voter violation." He got caught with stuff in New Hampshire. We caught him here with robo-calls. He's making robo-calls. They're doing a poll and they're saying Donald Trump is a horrible human being, bah, bah, bah, bah, and Ted Cruz is wonderful, what about Ted Cruz. What they're doing is -- you know, you know what it is, push pulse. We caught him. The really good ones are the ones who don't get caught. Every time he ever did anything, he got caught. But if you catch him and don't do anything about him, then it's your fault, OK.

UNIDENTIFIED: (INAUDIBLE QUESTION)

DONALD TRUMP: The what?

UNIDENTIFIED: (INAUDIBLE QUESTION)

DONALD TRUMP: Very simple. Great borders. We'll going to build a wall. By the way, Mexico's going to pay for the wall. These people say Mexico's not going to pay for the wall. Of course, they are. We lose so much money with Mexico in terms of deficit. We have a deficit with Mexico. That's so massive. They're going to pay for the wall. The wall is peanuts. Trust me, they're going to pay for the wall.

But we're going to have a strong military. We're going to take care of our vets, so important.

We were going to end Obamacare. It's going to be terminated. We're going to come up with something very good. Whether it's -- I mean, look, there's so many different plans. Now, part of the problem with the plans are the insurance companies dictated the plans to Obama. Insurance companies are making a fortune, some of them, with Obamacare. We're going to come up with a savings, you know -- you can do the health care savings plan. We're going to get rid of the boundaries around the states where it makes it totally non-competitive. So we're getting rid of Obamacare. We're repealing and replacing Obamacare.

Common Core is absolutely going to -- it's dead, it's the worse. We're number 30 in the world in education. You have Norway, Sweden, China, Denmark, you have these countries. We're number 30. We spend more per pupil. So Common Core is dead. We're getting rid of Common Core.

We're going to protect our Second Amendment. When I say dead, we're going to protect our Second Amendment and etcetera, OK.

UNIDENTIFIED: (INAUDIBLE QUESTION)

DONALD TRUMP: We're not going to let people come here from Guantanamo Bay. We are not letting people come to this area from Guantanamo Bay. You're talking about the local, local. We're going to let people come to this area from Guantanamo Bay. They're going to stay where they are right now. They're not coming to the country, let alone this area. But they're not coming to this area. And if they do come to this area before election time, before we take office, and I take office, they're going back. You can tell that to the local people, OK. You can bank on it.

UNIDENTIFIED: (INAUDIBLE QUESTION)

DONALD TRUMP: Winning South Carolina will be a great thing, I agree.

UNIDENTIFIED: (INAUDIBLE QUESTION)

DONALD TRUMP: I will tell you that I have received so many calls from people that you all know about and you write about and speak viciously about me when they want to come on board, OK. They're politicians. I've received so many calls. You can speak to Corey. We're not going to give you names anyway.

But, Corey, is that a correct statement, to put it mildly?

I've received so many calls. The most unsuspected people. John Holloway will say there's no way, there's no way that guy called. They called. People that you would not believe. It's all going to come together. I'm a unifier. People -- I'm not going to say that. I'm a unifier. Obama is not a unifier, by the way. I'm a unifier.

UNIDENTIFIED: (INAUDIBLE QUESTION)

DONALD TRUMP: I hope so. You know, look, we're working hard and we have a great relationship with the people of South Carolina. I hope it holds. You know, I can't tell you what's going to happen when a guy lies. When a guy lies about your record. That's why you have to get the truth out. But I think -- I think we should hold. I hope we're going to hold. I hope we're going to be successful.

My whole theme is "Make America great again." South Carolina's going to have a big part in that, because South Carolina -- I mean, you know, this could be the start. And maybe running the table. I say run the table. I think if we win South Carolina, we could conceivably run the table. We'll do very well.

UNIDENTIFIED: (INAUDIBLE QUESTION)

DONALD TRUMP: Oh, sure. I think they will anyway. I think you'll have certain people get out of the race.

UNIDENTIFIED: (INAUDIBLE QUESTION)

DONALD TRUMP: I think it would be better for him if he stayed out.

UNIDENTIFIED: (INAUDIBLE QUESTION)

DONALD TRUMP: No. I think I'm giving a rally.

UNIDENTIFIED: (INAUDIBLE QUESTION)

DONALD TRUMP: I'll see what happens. But I don't believe I'll be able to because I think I'm giving a rally at that time.

Am I?

Yes, I'm giving a rally.

UNIDENTIFIED: (INAUDIBLE QUESTION)

DONALD TRUMP: Weak, period.

UNIDENTIFIED: (INAUDIBLE QUESTION)

DONALD TRUMP: Yeah. Sure, I think it's great. You know what I want? I want dreamers to come from this country, OK. You mention dreamers --

(CROSSTALK)

Wait, you mentioned dreamers. I want dreamers to come from the United States. I want the people in the United States that have children, I want them to have dreams also. We're always talking about dreamers for other people. I want the children that are growing up in the United States to be dreamers also. They're not dreaming right now.

And you look at African-American youth, I mean, 58 percent unemployment. You look at African-Americans and they're 30 years old and they're 40 years old, and we have an African-American president, and he has not done anything for the African-Americans in this country, OK. And he got a free pass. And he shouldn't have. Because if that were me or if that was somebody else, we would be -- we would be taking other the calls, believe me. It would not be a good situation.

President Obama has done nothing for African-Americans. You look at African-Americans youth, if you look at African-Americans that are 30 years old, 40 years old, 50, in their prime, their prime, and take a look at their statistics, it's very sad.

OK, how about one or two more questions.

Yes, sir, go ahead.

What?

UNIDENTIFIED: (INAUDIBLE QUESTION)

DONALD TRUMP: I'll look at it.

Excuse me, that's enough.

UNIDENTIFIED: (INAUDIBLE QUESTION)

DONALD TRUMP: About Cuba?

UNIDENTIFIED: (INAUDIBLE QUESTION)

DONALD TRUMP: I think after 50 years, it's time, but we have to make a much better deal than we're making. We make bad deals. It's like the Keystone Pipeline. I'm totally in favor of it. But I have to get -- it's going to make a fortune, the Keystone Pipeline. By the way, we're using eminent domain. And if you noticed, an article came out today that Bush used private eminent domain in Florida, knocked out a veteran, disabled veteran. He was talking about private eminent domain, how horrible. But came out two major stories about him using private -- I mean, he just doesn't understand that, you know, things like that.

But, but the Keystone Pipeline, I will -- the Keystone Pipeline, but I will make a deal for this country where we get a chunk of it. Through eminent domain, we make the Keystone Pipeline and other things possible. They're going to make tremendous amounts of money from the Keystone Pipeline. A lot of the money they make is going to come back to the people of this country. You understand what I mean.

John?

UNIDENTIFIED: (INAUDIBLE QUESTION)

DONALD TRUMP: Lies. My only worry about South Carolina is that my opponents lie, especially Cruz. I mean, Cruz -- as I said, he's the single worst liar I've ever seen. If people believe the lies, then, you know, we won't make America great again, because nobody else is going to be able to do it but me. Believe me, I know my competition. They're all bought and paid for by the special interests.

They're not going to negotiate with the lumber companies, the drug companies, the oil and gas companies, the -- any of them. They're not going to make good trade deals, because trade deals are made by the lobbyists and the special interests.

Me, I'm going to have the greatest trade deals ever made. We're going to become rich again, and we're going to become great again. But I know my opponents. So, the thing that I would say, if I had a doubt, is when a guy is allowed to lie like Ted Cruz, where you can just say -- take an issue, boom, just make it the opposite, boom, make it the opposite, with no fact at all, and then I will get an apology.

On Sunday, I will get a phone call. Listen, I just want to say, I didn't realize -- OK -- like Carson did. Ben Carson got a call two hours after the election. He got a call. Frankly, in Iowa, they should have overturned the election based on what Cruz did, honestly, because he was so dishonest.

Between the voter violation and that, they should actually overturn it. If they had a strong leader in Iowa in terms of the Republican Party -- Jeff is a good guy, but perhaps he's not strong -- I don't know -- but what Cruz did is a fraud. What they should do is overturn that election.

OK, one more question. Go ahead. How about you in the back?

UNIDENTIFIED: (OFF-MIKE)

DONALD TRUMP: OK. No, he wouldn't be on my short list. No, he would not be.

OK, good luck, everybody. Thank you.

Yes?

UNIDENTIFIED: (OFF-MIKE)

DONALD TRUMP: The RNC is in default. OK?

The RNC -- just you so understand, the RNC is in default. Yes, I understand. When somebody is in default, that means the other side can do what they have to do, OK? The RNC is in default. The RNC gave all the tickets to special interests that represented Cruz and Rubio.

They had all the tickets. They walked on stage and the place went crazy. It was sort of interesting. One guy has got very low in the polls, the other one is pretty low in the polls. I'm very high. There was nobody in the room. I had my wife and kids, OK?

Because I don't have donors. I don't have donors and I don't have special interests. I don't have any of that. But I think the RNC did a very poor job. Now, we have warned them twice, because this happened twice before, so we have warned them, and they don't listen. I think the RNC is controlled.

The bottom line is the RNC is controlled by the establishment, and the RNC is controlled by the special interests and the donors, and that's too bad, because that's not good for the race. And that's why the Republican Party for president has lost so much for so long.

Thank you all very much. I appreciate it. Thank you.

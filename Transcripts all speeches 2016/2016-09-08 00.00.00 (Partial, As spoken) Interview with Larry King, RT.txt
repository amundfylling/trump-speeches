LARRY KING: Putin recently said that the hacking of the Democratic National Committee emails was a public service. Do you agree?

DONALD TRUMP: I don't have any opinion on it. I don't know anything about it. I don't know who hacked. I'm not sure who. I mean, you tell me who hacked? Who did the hacking? But, I have absolutely no opinion on that. I don't know, I haven't heard that statement.

LARRY KING: U.S. intelligence and law-enforcement agencies reportedly are investigating whether Russia launched a covert operation to disrupt the 2016 election. What do you make of that?

DONALD TRUMP: I don't know. I mean I've been hearing about it, I've been reading about it. I think it's probably unlikely. I think maybe the Democrats are putting that out. Who knows? But I think that it's pretty unlikely. But, who knows? I hope that if they are doing something, I hope that someone's going to be able to find out so they can end it. Because, that would not be appropriate at all.

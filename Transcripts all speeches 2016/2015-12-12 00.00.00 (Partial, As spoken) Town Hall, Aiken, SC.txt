DONALD TRUMP: We have a horrible situation that took place a week ago in California. Now, they came in, they shot 14 people. Others are dying right now. You will have more because they are very badly wounded. I have a right to carry. I'm a member of the NRA. My sons are members, long time. They are much better shots than I am, I will tell you. They're actually really good. But they're members. But if I were there, if you were there, if anybody here had a weapon, if you were in that room, those people wouldn't have shot 14 people. We might have gone down fighting. But they're going down with us.

This will finally be the year the American people say enough is enough. Enough is enough.

Speaking in secret to a foreign bank, Hillary Clinton said her dream is for total open trade and open borders. There go the rest of your jobs.

(BOOING)

There go the rest of your jobs. Hillary and Bill raise millions of dollars from global interest groups who have no allegiance to our country or our workers whatsoever. They couldn't care less. By open trade, she means foreign countries can cheat us out of jobs and trillions of dollars. By open borders, she means totally unlimited immigration pouring into our country.

(BOOING)

Either we win the election or we lose the country. And this is the last time. We have -- this is it. November 8th. This is it. We're going either win or we'll have a whole different country. And it's never going to come back. Never comes back.

(CHANTING)

Thank you.

Hillary's plan includes an open border with the Middle East, meaning generations of radicalism within our shores. She refuses to mention the term "radical Islamic terrorism."

DONALD TRUMP: And I will tell you, I've been all over this country. And our country is in trouble. But we will make America great again, and it's going go very quickly.

(APPLAUSE)

Very, very quickly.... want to start off by thanking John and the committee, and everybody. I know this is a record. I hear it's a big record, like a record by a lot. So this is your all-time record and we like that, right? We're part of it.

(APPLAUSE)

You know, in coming out today, I wanted to do a little work, and don't be depressed, because what's going to happen is these numbers will turnaround quickly, OK? They're going to turn around quickly, but I ask a few questions about -- you know, I've been here so much, my life, I've been here my life, and people are leaving, but we're not going to let them leave anymore. And when I say people, I'm talking about companies, we're not going to make it so easy to leave anymore. We can't do that. But you know, I asked -- I asked them to do me a little work and just a little bit. I want to talk about how we bring it back, we're going to bring it back and it's going to go a lot faster than people understand. You know, I'm self- funding my campaign. So I don't have to listen to all of my donors and all of my people.

(APPLAUSE)

That give me money and they say here's money, go get elected and after you're elected, you better do what we're telling to you do. It's not going to happen, OK?

(APPLAUSE)

We know that whole deal. But few regions of the country have been hurt worse than Suffolk. You know that. OK. You know that. I don't even know why. It's so beautiful out here. It's like one of the really beautiful places, but it's jobs, and they're moving into Mexico. They're moving all over. That's not going to happen for long. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Suffolk, Nassau region of New York lost more than half of its manufacturing jobs since 1990. That's not good, folks.

(BOOING)

I can't believe it. I know some of the guys in this room. They're so tough. Some of the tough guys I know. I can't believe you guys would allow that to happen. What the hell, are you getting soft? They're getting soft on me. I don't believe this, right? They know what I'm talking about. Also, according to the bureau, the region has lost 30 percent of its manufacturing since just 2001. It's crazy. And you know, really, a big part of it, folks, is the fact, and it's such an important thing, the fact that the politicians aren't fighting for our country anymore. They don't fight for us.

(APPLAUSE)

You know, when you look at China, when you look at Japan, when you look at Mexico, you look at Vietnam, you look at so many different countries all over the world, they're devaluing their currency, they're so much smart than our leaders. It's like a great football team in the NFL playing your high school team. I like that sound. I like that. But it's like a great team -- you just can't do it. We need our best people. I know the best people. We know the best negotiators in the world. We have great people. We have the greatest business people in the world right here, right here.

(APPLAUSE)

We don't use them. We don't use them. We are going to start using them big league. And by the way, we don't want to ever forget, we're going to have strong borders. We're going to have a wall. The wall's going to be built. You of course know who's paying for the wall. Right, who's paying?

(APPLAUSE)

We're going to stop the drugs from pouring into our country and poisoning our youth. We're going to do so many things. We're going to get rid of Obamacare, get rid of it fast. It's no good, doesn't work. Your premiums are going up. You see it, 35, 45, 55 percent every year. It's crazy. Now, we're going to get rid of it. We're going to get great healthcare at a much smaller cost. Better at less money, right?

(APPLAUSE)

Always protect our Second Amendment, you know that, right? Right?

(APPLAUSE)

So you look at this and it's one of those things. Now, with John and some of the people, you have some great people out here. You have some great, great, and you really do, you have some really good politicians, they know what's going on. Wow. I'm not going to read this stat. It's too negative, the hell with that.

(APPLAUSE)

I mean, that was a bad one. I couldn't read it. I want you walking away happy today. We broke the record, I want you walking away happy today. Wow. There are some bad things going on. So we're going to be really smart, and I'm going to talk about trade. You know, when I did this, who knew this was going to happen with Trump, right? And I'm one of you. Who knew this was going to happen? But when I announced on June 16, and I didn't -- my wife and I were coming down on the escalator. A couple of people have seen the picture. And I said come on, let's do it, they're doing the Iran deal, it was so bad, so pathetic, I looked at it, I looked at the way they negotiated. I said these people don't know what they're doing. How about that deal? We give in $150 billion, we get nothing. The prisoners don't get released. They should have been released before we ever started negotiating. It's an insult. That's right. No deal. It means you get up and you walk. You get up and you walk, and we never walk. So, here's what we're to do. We're going to end up, and you know, when you see the manufacturing, when you see the people build that wall. What's more important to you, the wall or the trade deals?

We'll talk about trade. Because I know this area. They want business coming back in. I see what's going on. I know what's going on. I come here, I have many friends from this place, I have to tell you, and they're tough. These are tough. I have tough friends. But let me just tell you, we're going to bring it back, bring it back fast. You probably read and you probably saw Ford building massive plants in Mexico. Ford Motor. You probably saw -- think about it, I'm sure you saw the Carrier air conditioning fired 1400 people, 1400 people, and then moved to Mexico. What do we get out of it? We get nothing out of it whatsoever. These are great people. I spoke to some of them. These are great people. They got knocked off like you've never seen, it's not happening. So here's what we're going to do. Carrier, your companies, you can do any country. You know, Nabisco, big plants, big plants in Chicago. They're moving to Mexico, everyone they're moving to Mexico, moving all over. They're moving everywhere but here

(BOOING)

So here's what we're doing, take Carrier as an example. They'll be making air conditioners. And we call them and say good luck, enjoy your new plants in Mexico, have a lot of fun, but every single time you make an air-conditioning unit, you're going to cross a very strong border now. No longer a Swiss cheese. We just got approved by the way, endorsed by 15,500 border patrol agents, which is phenomenal.

(APPLAUSE)

First time in the history that they endorsed a presidential candidate. Just got endorsed by Sheriff Joe from Arizona. Do we love Sheriff Joe?

(APPLAUSE)

So we tell Carrier, here's the story, folks, I hope you're going to enjoy your plant, but here's the story. Every time you make an AC unit, it crosses the border. You're going to pay a 35 percent tax on that unit. OK?

(APPLAUSE)

Believe me. Believe me. Now, the free traders -- and I'm a free trader, but our people don't understand free trade. Our leaders have no clue, and to have free trade, you need smart people. We don't have smart people at the top. We don't have people -- we don't have people. And I'll tell you the truth. You take a guy like Lyin' Ted Cruz.

(BOOING)

Lyin' Ted, right? You know, he talked about New York values. Did you see the debate? He talked about New York values.

AUDIENCE: Lyin' Ted! Lyin' Ted! Lyin' Ted! Lyin' Ted!

DONALD TRUMP: Right. I love this. Look at this woman. Woman for Trump, Women for Trump! Thank you. Women for Trump. You better believe it. You better believe it. We're going to do great with the Women with Trump. Thank you very much, it's very nice. Here's the story. So Lyin' Ted Cruz talked about New York values at the debate, and he talked about it with anger and really hatred. I mean, he was trying to make a point against me. Boy, did that hit him hard. Because he's doing very well. Right now, he's I guess number three in the polls in New York and many of the other states. And nobody even knows who number two is. They don't know.

AUDIENCE: Lyin' Ted! Lyin' Ted! Lyin' Ted! Lyin' Ted!

DONALD TRUMP: Isn't it amazing the way some names just stick to people. I know plenty of my friends in here, right up there. They've got the nicknames that we gave them to. I like them better than Lyin' Ted, let me tell you. But you know, Lyin' Ted comes in with the Bible held high, you know that, right? It is held high, he puts the Bible down and then he starts lying all day long.

So anyway -- so here is what's going to happen. We tell Carrier air conditioner, we tell them. Folks, sorry, 35 percent tax, you move.

SEAN HANNITY: And welcome to "Hannity." And tonight, we're coming to you from South Carolina, where the state's Republican primary is only two days away. And we have brand-new Fox News poll numbers out of the Palmetto State.

Donald Trump is leading the field by double digits, with 32 percent, Texas senator Ted Cruz in second with 19 percent, Senator Marco Rubio in third place with 15 percent. And they're followed by Ben Carson, Jeb Bush and John Kasich.

And in a brand-new Fox News national poll, Trump is out in front, 36 percent, Cruz in second 19 percent. Marco Rubio comes in third at 15 percent. Then it's Carson, Bush and Kasich.

Now, earlier today, we caught up with the GOP front-runner, Donald, Trump on the campaign trail right here in South Carolina. Take a look.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

Mr. Trump, poll numbers Fox came out today, you're at 32 percent, consistent with all the other polls that have been out there. Are you feeling confident going into Saturday?

DONALD TRUMP: Well, I do. I mean, we're going to see what happens. I'll tell you what, South Carolina is an incredible place. I've been here many, many times. I have many friends here long before the political stuff. And I feel very good. I mean, we feel very confident. I'm making four, five speeches today and tomorrow.

SEAN HANNITY: And you have the biggest crowds.

DONALD TRUMP: I have the biggest crowds.

SEAN HANNITY: It was interesting because you kind of a little bit underperformed in Iowa, way overperformed in New Hampshire. The poll numbers here look very similar to New Hampshire. Are you expecting similar results?

DONALD TRUMP: Well, I think I really performed well in Iowa, you know, in terms of going in. They went in -- this caucus thing is crazy. They went in and they all said they're voting for Trump, and then people would do numbers on them inside. And there was a very crooked deal going on there. I'll tell you what. That whole Iowa thing was terrible with Ted Cruz, what he did with Ben Carson, etcetera.

But I think we really did well in Iowa, picked up a lot of delegates, came in a very strong second. But we did really well in New Hampshire. New Hampshire was so incredible to us. We won in a landslide and we won with every a single group. And this feels very much like New Hampshire.

SEAN HANNITY: All right I want to get back to the horse race in a minute. Let me go to the main attack line that is being used against you.

DONALD TRUMP: OK.

SEAN HANNITY: You're not a conservative.

DONALD TRUMP: OK. Well, I am a conservative.

SEAN HANNITY: Explain.

DONALD TRUMP: If you look at me and if you look at any kind of a record you want to look at, I'm by far the strongest on military. I'm by far the strongest of any candidate on 2nd Amendment. I'm by far the strongest on getting rid of Common Core and bringing the education to a local, so that local people can educate their kids, which is 10 times better.

You look at where we stand, worldwide education -- it's a horror show. We're number 30 in the world.

SEAN HANNITY: We spend the most money.

DONALD TRUMP: So we get rid of -- absolutely. We get rid of Common Core 100 percent. I'm the strongest on Obamacare. I've been talking to you about Obamacare  from the day they proposed it. I said, You got to get rid of it, it's going to be a -- and I know because I have thousands of employees. And over the years, I've had tens of thousands of employees. So I understand more about health care than anybody. We have to get rid of Obamacare. We're going to repeal it and replace it.

I mean, I'm the most conservative -- oh, by the way, on trade, there's nobody more conservative than me. I will make great trade deals.

SEAN HANNITY: Let me go to the heart...

DONALD TRUMP: We have the world's worst trade deals, by the way, just so you know.

SEAN HANNITY: I agree, and it would hurt -- it would certainly help economic growth. I guess for some people -- they say, OK, well, Donald Trump was a New York businessman and he was a liberal then. Explain how you became a conservative. Maybe that would help some people understand.

DONALD TRUMP: Right. Well, first of all, as a businessman, it wasn't like you were liberal. You were sort of like nothing. You didn't talk about these things. You didn't talk about pro-choice. You didn't talk about you are in favor or not in favor of abortion. You didn't -- I mean, it wasn't like -- you know, you're building buildings and you're dealing with contractors and you're dealing with tough people and...

(CROSSTALK)

... dealing with politicians. But you weren't in -- you weren't in the world of politics, and you never were asked.

I mean, they talk about pro-choice, which I am not. You know, I've totally evolved on that whole thing. But it was something you never talked about. You didn't talk about borders. You didn't talk about all of these things.

Now, on many of these subjects or most of these subjects, I think -- you know, you mentioned the word conservative. I like to say I'm a conservative with common sense or I'm a common sense conservative. And it's a term nobody's ever heard of because I just came up with it about two days ago because some of these things that these people come up with are crazy.

But I'm the most conservative when it comes to military, when it comes to the border, when it comes to security. That's why every poll you people do, I come out number one by -- not -- not by, like, 2 points. I come out number one where I'm in the 60s and 70 percentages. And when it comes to security, when it comes to illegal immigration, all of these things, I think I'm the most conservative person there is.

SEAN HANNITY: So then why the attacks about, Well, he used to be? Is it -- is it just because...

DONALD TRUMP: Well, they say that, but...

SEAN HANNITY: ... that's the only line of attack...

(CROSSTALK)

DONALD TRUMP: ... Ronald Reagan, OK? So I'm pro-life.

SEAN HANNITY: Right.

DONALD TRUMP: And you know that. I've been -- I've been on your show...

SEAN HANNITY: You told the story in the first debate.

DONALD TRUMP: I did. And I told the story. I don't know if I have to tell the story again now, but I mean, I've seen things. And I'm pro-life. And people know I'm pro-life. But Ronald Reagan, you know, was pro-choice, and Ronald Reagan passed an abortion law in California that was one of the worst in the country. I mean, it was a terrible thing. And he became president, became a great president. But he was actually a somewhat liberal Democrat and he ended up being a somewhat conservative conservative.

(CROSSTALK)

SEAN HANNITY: ... Reagan.

DONALD TRUMP: Well, he wasn't very conservative, but he was...

(CROSSTALK)

More importantly, he ended up being a great president.

SEAN HANNITY: Do you -- so you're going to build a wall. That's conservative. Can you balance a budget? Do you believe it's possible?

DONALD TRUMP: Oh, absolutely.

SEAN HANNITY: You know, $20 trillion in debt.

DONALD TRUMP: Very quickly. I even like your penny plan. You know, I'm a very sophisticated guy. I went to the best business school in the world and all of that stuff. I like your penny plan. I mean -- and you can do more than a penny.

SEAN HANNITY: People may not know. The penny plan is -- and it's not mine -- Connie Mack. I got to give him credit. Cut a penny out of every dollar every year for six years, you balance the budget. You would add...

DONALD TRUMP: If you have the right people leading your agencies and leading your different groups, you could do that.

(CROSSTALK)

SEAN HANNITY: Waste, fraud and abuse.

DONALD TRUMP: Or you could do it quicker. You know, some of these politicians think you can't balance the budget. Some of them think it's going to take 25 years. You've had them on your show, where they say, We think over a 25-year period, we can get the budget -- and you know that's not going to happen.

SEAN HANNITY: We always get the promise that we're going to get lower spending and higher taxes. You get the taxes, you don't get the spending. You get amnesty, you never get the wall. So you...

DONALD TRUMP: Sean, I've seen politicians on your show that you are for and they're getting ready to go to Washington for the first time. And they're going to get rid of Obamacare, they're going to do this and that, all these things that you have to do. They're going to balance the budget...

SEAN HANNITY: Doesn't happen.

DONALD TRUMP: A year later, you have them on your show, they haven't done anything.

SEAN HANNITY: Yes.

DONALD TRUMP: They talk.

SEAN HANNITY: Listen, I'm not even sure that they'll hold the line, the position that they've taken on Justice Scalia's replacement.

DONALD TRUMP: Can I tell you what I saw yesterday? So the first, there's like -- the Republicans -- don't forget Obama's a horrible negotiator, worst deal I've seen on Iran. He's a terrible negotiator, except when it comes to the Republicans. And I saw it yesterday, Sean.

So Scalia, great guy, dies, right? And the republicans say, We don't want -- -- and they're all very brave, and, We have the right, and, We have the Senate, and, We're not going to give you any vote, OK, everything that they're supposed to be saying, they're been.

Then yesterday, I heard there may be some weakening on the Republican...

SEAN HANNITY: I saw the knees buckling. I saw the same thing.

DONALD TRUMP: I saw it for the first time.

SEAN HANNITY: Yes.

DONALD TRUMP: In other words, a day goes by, all of a sudden -- I'm telling you, these people need a strong leader.

SEAN HANNITY: Yes.

DONALD TRUMP: These people are weak.

SEAN HANNITY: So let's talk about spending...

DONALD TRUMP: Don't be surprised if...

(CROSSTALK)

SEAN HANNITY: ... important to you. You want to eliminate baseline budgeting. Cut...

DONALD TRUMP: Absolutely. Yes.

SEAN HANNITY: ... waste, fraud and abuse.

DONALD TRUMP: Right.

SEAN HANNITY: How important is lowering taxes for economic growth?

DONALD TRUMP: Very important. I have my policy, and I have the biggest tax cut there is of all of them. We have a tax cut for the middle class. We have a tax cut for business. Our business, our middle class -- we're paying the highest taxes in the world, Sean. We are paying in this country the highest taxes in the world. So I have big tax cuts for the middle class. You know, we've forgotten about -- the country has forgotten about the middle class.

SEAN HANNITY: It's shrinking.

DONALD TRUMP: No, no, they built our country, OK?

SEAN HANNITY: They're suffering.

DONALD TRUMP: And they're paying too much tax. We're cutting taxes for the middle class. We're cutting taxes for business. We're cutting tax so we can bring our $2.5 trillion into the country.

(CROSSTALK)

SEAN HANNITY: Repatriated money, trillions of...

DONALD TRUMP: Corporate inversion. I mean, you look what's going on with corporations, where Pfizer is leaving this country. How about where a Chinese company is buying the Chicago Stock Exchange, OK?

SEAN HANNITY: Well, you what happened with the Carrier workers.

DONALD TRUMP: Carrier is leaving. They're going to Mexico.

SEAN HANNITY: Into Mexico.

DONALD TRUMP: And I know how to stop that.

SEAN HANNITY: So you'll repatriate that, give them an incentive to bring that money back, build manufacturing centers, factories here.

DONALD TRUMP: Absolutely. We want that $2.5 trillion here. You know, the interesting thing is the Democrats want it to happen and the Republicans want it to happen, but we have no leader, so they can't -- I could sit them in a room there, and within two minutes, you'd have that deal worked out.

But we have no leader. We have a president that doesn't lead. Everybody wants the money to come back, even the Democrats. But we have no leader to sit them in a room and say, Come on, let's get it done. You need a quick signing.

SEAN HANNITY: I've asked you at least three, four times about your replacement for Obamacare. And for some reason, the press never picks up on your answer.

DONALD TRUMP: Well, I talk health care savings. You know, you look at health care...

SEAN HANNITY: Health care savings accounts.

DONALD TRUMP: You look at -- you look at getting rid of the lines. I've been talking to you about that a lot. You have to get rid of the lines.

SEAN HANNITY: In other words, buying across state lines.

DONALD TRUMP: Absolutely! There's no competition. And you know why? Because all of the politicians that you have on your show all the time are paid off by the insurance companies. That's all. It's very simple -- meaning campaign contributions. As much as you like them, they get campaign contributions...

SEAN HANNITY: No, I don't like them. I don't give money to any of them.

DONALD TRUMP: (INAUDIBLE) your show. No, no, no. I know.

SEAN HANNITY: They don't get any money.

DONALD TRUMP: But they were on your show.

SEAN HANNITY: Yes.

DONALD TRUMP: And the truth is they get tremendous campaign contributions from the insurance companies. They're making a fortune. Obama got taken care of by the insurance companies. Obamacare  is a windfall for many insurance companies.

SEAN HANNITY: Well, it's also forcing young people to buy plans they don't need...

DONALD TRUMP: Oh, it's sad.

SEAN HANNITY: ... and with a health care savings accounts, you can get a high deductible, catastrophic care, and you pay four times less.

DONALD TRUMP: It's great. But you have to get rid of the lines so you have competition also.

SEAN HANNITY: And can take it portability job to job.

DONALD TRUMP: Portability is very important.

SEAN HANNITY: All right, what about -- you said education. You would take the entire Department of Education and take the money that we're spending federally on education and give that money to cities and states?

DONALD TRUMP: Give it to the states. Absolutely. And to have -- look -- and they can do it with real love and with heart. You got to bring education -- if we were doing well on education, I'd say, Fine. We're ranked number 30 in the world. You have China, Denmark, Sweden, Norway -- these countries are all the best countries, right?

SEAN HANNITY: (INAUDIBLE) spending INAUDIBLE

DONALD TRUMP: We're ranked number -- we pay per pupil so many times more than number two. Number two doesn't even exist. We pay so much more per pupil. Department of Education is a disaster. We have to bring -- get rid of Common Core, bring education local.

SEAN HANNITY: I asked you earlier in the week who you would like to replace or the type of justice you're looking for on the Supreme Court. A lot of people said, Well, you cited your sister, who took a very controversial...

DONALD TRUMP: I cited my sister jokingly because I had a conflict, obviously. I said, Oh, I think my sister. And I did it with a big laugh on my face and I'm having fun. I have a great sister, who, by the way, is totally brilliant and a wonderful woman. But I have a conflict. So I said, Oh, I'll put my sister. That's the way I did it. I didn't...

(CROSSTALK)

My sister wouldn't want it. My sister wouldn't do it.

SEAN HANNITY: Your two favorite justices on the court now?

DONALD TRUMP: Well, Scalia was one. And I'll tell you something. I think a man who's so underrated and he's so solid is Justice Thomas.

SEAN HANNITY: I agree with you.

DONALD TRUMP: He doesn't get enough credit. He's been a rock just about more than any of them.

SEAN HANNITY: Did you ever read his book "My Grandfather's Son"?

DONALD TRUMP: I've seen the book. I have not read the book.

SEAN HANNITY: Really good book.

DONALD TRUMP: I'll look at it.

SEAN HANNITY: All right, you talk about...

DONALD TRUMP: Do you agree with that?

SEAN HANNITY: Yes. I think...

DONALD TRUMP: He doesn't -- he doesn't get enough credit.

SEAN HANNITY: Very different personality than Scalia. Scalia jokes, has a lot of...

DONALD TRUMP: Like the opposite.

SEAN HANNITY: ... comments...

DONALD TRUMP: Like the opposite.

SEAN HANNITY: ... you know, biting dissents and opinions...

DONALD TRUMP: But he's been a rock.

SEAN HANNITY: But very solid originalist. So you're looking for an originalist.

DONALD TRUMP: Yes, I am.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

SEAN HANNITY: And coming up, part two of our interview with 2016 GOP front- runner Donald Trump.

Then later tonight...

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

DONALD TRUMP: If and when the Vatican is attacked by ISIS, which as everyone knows, is ISIS's ultimate trophy, I can promise you that the pope would have only wished and prayed that Donald Trump would have been president!

(END VIDEO CLIP)

SEAN HANNITY: Donald Trump responds to the pope saying that he's not a Christian. Liberty University president Jerry Falwell, Jr., and Pastor Robert Jeffress are here tonight with reaction.

Plus, we'll check in with Ohio governor John Kasich.

And a quick programming note. You want to make sure to tune in tomorrow night, 10:00 Eastern. We hit the campaign trail with Senator Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, the biggest interviews on the biggest stage only here on the campaign trail on 'Hannity."

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

(NEWSBREAK)

And welcome back to "Hannity." And here's part two of our interview from earlier today with 2016 Republican front-runner Donald Trump.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

Let me go to the issue of comments you made last night. We're talking about the Israeli/Palestinian conflict.

DONALD TRUMP: Right. Toughest deal to make of any kind of deal that I've ever seen is Israel/Palestine.

SEAN HANNITY: Because it's such a mess.

DONALD TRUMP: Tough issue. The Palestinians and the Israelis don't exactly -- they're not exactly meshing.

SEAN HANNITY: Yes.

DONALD TRUMP: And you know, one of the reasons that I said it last night -- the toughest single deal to make is getting them together. And I've been told by some Israelis that no matter who it is, you'll never do it. I'm going to give it a shot, but I will say it is probably of all the deals, right...

SEAN HANNITY: You did mention these kids that are funded by Hamas and Hezbollah.

DONALD TRUMP: They grow up hating.

SEAN HANNITY: They've grown up to hate Israel.

DONALD TRUMP: That's why it's so tough, they grew up hating. They grow up -- things were told to me that are incredible and I won't even say...

(CROSSTALK)

SEAN HANNITY: How important, though, is our alliance? They're our number one ally in the region, and that alliance has been, well, fractured in a big way.

DONALD TRUMP: Israel is so important. What Obama has done to Israel is a disgrace. How they even talk to us is hard to believe. But Israel -- and how they talk to Obama -- you know, I have friends, they support Obama. I said, How do you do it? It's almost like they do it out of habit.

They agree he's been terrible. You look at what he's done to Israel with just this Iran deal, which is such a terrible deal. He has been the worst thing that's ever happened to Israel. Now, a lot of my friends that are Jewish do not support him any longer, but I still have some that do. I say, How can you do it...

SEAN HANNITY: He's been horrible to Israel.

DONALD TRUMP: You know what? I think it's habit. They do it out of habit.

SEAN HANNITY: What do you think of Prime Minister Netanyahu?

DONALD TRUMP: I think he's good. I like him.

SEAN HANNITY: Strong.

DONALD TRUMP: He's always been -- he's strong. He's always been good to me. He asked me to do a commercial for him. I was his only celebrity that he asked to do a commercial, Would you do a commercial, when he ran for office. But I think he's very good. I think he's been treated very, very badly by Obama.

SEAN HANNITY: Let me get you to expand -- you always talk about trade, free trade. You say you're free trade, or fair trade.

DONALD TRUMP: Look, I want to be smart trade. It's good to be smart.

SEAN HANNITY: But not protectionist.

DONALD TRUMP: No, not protectionist. But you have to use that as a -- as a...

SEAN HANNITY: Leverage.

DONALD TRUMP: Of course.

SEAN HANNITY: In negotiations.

DONALD TRUMP: We don't use anything. Hey, look, we let China dump their stuff on us, but if you try and do business in China, you can't. I mean, it's impossible. You can't get your stuff in. It's very hard.

SEAN HANNITY: Right.

DONALD TRUMP: You can't get your stuff in. And you have to pay tax. So it's got to be equal. It's not equal. And we're losing $500 billion this year...

SEAN HANNITY: In a trade deficit with China.

DONALD TRUMP: We have a trade deficit with China. We're $500 billion -- I'm going to negotiate. Believe me, we're not going to...

SEAN HANNITY: You want U.S. cars sold in China.

DONALD TRUMP: I want -- yes. And I want them made here and sold in China.

SEAN HANNITY: Exactly.

DONALD TRUMP: Like Boeing. Boeing goes and takes an order, now they have to build airplane factories in China. And be careful, South Carolina and other places, and Seattle, by the way...

SEAN HANNITY: They're going to lose factories and manufacturers...

(CROSSTALK)

DONALD TRUMP: Eventually, in five years, they'll start doing their monetary manipulation again, Sean. Nobody has ever manipulated a currency -- they're, like, chess grand masters, OK?

SEAN HANNITY: Yes.

DONALD TRUMP: Nobody's ever done it like China. And I told the folks last night, right here, I said, Be careful of your Boeing plant because you think it's good now, but in three years, when the ones are built, the big ones in China, and the currency manipulation takes place, South Carolina is going to have a problem.

SEAN HANNITY: Think how bad the economy is when you talk about banks now charging you to keep your money.

DONALD TRUMP: Yes, that's right. It's opposite. It's opposite.

SEAN HANNITY: Let me ask you this. You actually said something that really intrigued me. There's still 28 pages of the 9/11 commission report...

DONALD TRUMP: Right.

SEAN HANNITY: ... that have never been revealed.

DONALD TRUMP: Right. And they should reveal it.

SEAN HANNITY: I got the impression that you knew something maybe we don't know about the Saudis...

DONALD TRUMP: I think you'll find out when that's opened -- I think you're going to find out Saudi Arabia had a lot to do with ripping down of the World Trade Center.

SEAN HANNITY: Would you open that if you became president?

DONALD TRUMP: I would open it, yes.

SEAN HANNITY: You would.

(CROSSTALK)

... the American people...

DONALD TRUMP: What I'm saying -- and look, we attacked Iraq. But Iraq didn't knock down the World Trade Center. When you open up those pages, you're going to find out who did it.

SEAN HANNITY: That's pretty interesting. I played a tape for you on my radio show the other day. Bill Clinton gave a speech. He'd been offered bin Laden, knew bin Laden was a threat...

DONALD TRUMP: Should have taken him out.

SEAN HANNITY: Should have taken him out.

DONALD TRUMP: Should have taken him out.

SEAN HANNITY: And also, even though you were against the war -- and you and I had some debates at the time. You were against the war from the beginning.

DONALD TRUMP: Totally against the war. And you would know that because you and I have been doing this for a long time.

SEAN HANNITY: We just disagree.

DONALD TRUMP: And you and I used to fight about it.

SEAN HANNITY: We used to fight about it.

DONALD TRUMP: Now you probably say Trump was sort of, like, right. Not sort of right.

SEAN HANNITY: Well, the thing is, once we go to war, what I'm afraid of is -- we lose 58,000 people in Vietnam, we lose 5,000 people in Iraq, and then Obama politicizes it or they politicize Vietnam, and why did we send American sons and daughters to fight, bleed and die, and then we only give Ramadi, Fallujah, Mosul and Tikrit over to ISIS? That's insanity!

DONALD TRUMP: We shouldn't have gone into Iraq because we destabilized the Middle East. OK, once we're in...

SEAN HANNITY: You win.

DONALD TRUMP: ... the way we got out was horrible. You win. You're right. But the way we got out was horrible, where he announces a date, and now the enemy pulls back, and they say, Why should we fight? You know, despite what you hear, they don't want to die. They say, Why should we fight? We get out, and the mess starts. But we should have left troops. I didn't want to go in, but we should have left troops there.

SEAN HANNITY: And keep -- and sustain the victories we have.

DONALD TRUMP: We should have done something.

SEAN HANNITY: And I do agree with you about keeping the oil and giving the money to the military.

DONALD TRUMP: I've been saying it for four years.

SEAN HANNITY: Why are we paying the cost?

DONALD TRUMP: Now ISIS is so rich, and also paying the cost for all of these armies that we're supporting. I mean, Saudi Arabia, so rich, making a billion dollars a day before the oil went down, so now they're making half, right?

SEAN HANNITY: I was glad to hear you say the other day there were only three people that were waterboarded totally. One was Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who gave the information about the courier that led to bin Laden...

DONALD TRUMP: Right.

SEAN HANNITY: ... unknown story, it seems, by a lot of people. And I always use the analogy, if you saw your child getting kidnapped by three people and you tackled one of the three and two people got away with your child, what wouldn't you do to get the information? You said you would go further. Explain.

DONALD TRUMP: This came up with Ted Cruz. They asked him a question about waterboarding, you know, Is it good, is it fine, is it OK? And he was very weak on his answer. It was a bad, bad answer. And I could see he didn't -- he wanted to stay away from it. He didn't like it. I mean, I understand that. He didn't like it.

Then they said, What would you do? I said, I'd approve it immediately and I'd make it worse. OK?

SEAN HANNITY: In other words, whatever it took to get information.

DONALD TRUMP: Whatever it took. Excuse me. And I prefaced it by saying in the Middle East, they're chopping off heads. I haven't seen that since medieval times. I read when I was a young guy in history class, I would read about medieval times, they chopped off heads. Now James Foley, these wonderful people -- I know his parents. They're incredible people. They're chopping off heads.

SEAN HANNITY: Scary.

DONALD TRUMP: OK?

SEAN HANNITY: It's evil in our time.

DONALD TRUMP: And here we are, they're chopping off heads. And we want information about them and we can't waterboard, OK? We can't waterboard. No. So when they came to me -- by the way, it was very interesting. They came to me. They asked me the same question. I said, I'd approve it immediately, but it's got to be worse. And I got a standing ovation. I didn't know what I was going to get. You know, I didn't exactly poll it. I don't poll things.

SEAN HANNITY: You don't have pollsters at all.

DONALD TRUMP: No, I do what's right.

SEAN HANNITY: What's your reaction to Obama saying Donald Trump won't be president, I don't believe he'll be president?

DONALD TRUMP: Well, I was complimented. He's been the worst president in the history of our country. I was complimented. And I actually said it's lucky he didn't -- that I didn't run four years ago because, unfortunately, Romney didn't take us to the promised land. It didn't work out for Romney. But I said, You're lucky I didn't run four years ago because you wouldn't be a two-term president. And I really mean that. I think I would have -- you remember when I was thinking about running and...

SEAN HANNITY: I do remember.

DONALD TRUMP: ... I was number one in all the polls and everything. But I was very busy. I had many, many jobs going up all over the world, and I had my children that were sort of young and learning. And well, now they're in great shape, Ivanka, Don, Eric, and I have great executives. So doesn't matter.

SEAN HANNITY: Conservatives were concerned in the debate about -- you said about Planned Parenthood, They do good things for women. I just don't like the abortion side. Here's my question.

DONALD TRUMP: That's what I said. It's true.

SEAN HANNITY: Should American taxpayers, though, pay $500 billion to that organization?

DONALD TRUMP: No, I said defund. I didn't say pay. I said I have a lot of respect for some of the things they do, the cervical cancer on women. They do many, many good things. I know many women...

(CROSSTALK)

SEAN HANNITY: ... no taxpayer money.

DONALD TRUMP: No, not while they do abortions. I made that clear. I made that clear, I think, at the debate.

SEAN HANNITY: All right, last question. Things are getting heated. It always happens historically in South Carolina. You threatened a lawsuit with Cruz. Where does that stand?

DONALD TRUMP: Well, we'll see. I mean, I have a couple of them in theory. Was he born -- he was born in Canada. He lived there for four years. He was a citizen of Canada until 15 months ago.

SEAN HANNITY: You're not going to file that lawsuit, will you?

DONALD TRUMP: I'll have to get your approval, OK?

(LAUGHTER)

SEAN HANNITY: Mr. Trump, good to see you.

DONALD TRUMP: Thank you, Sean.

SEAN HANNITY: Thank you. Appreciate it.

DONALD TRUMP: Thanks, Sean.

SEAN HANNITY: Thanks so much.

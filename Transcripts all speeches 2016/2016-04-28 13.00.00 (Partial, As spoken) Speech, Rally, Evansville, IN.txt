DONALD TRUMP: And then I'm watching this morning and Lyin' Ted, Donald Trump loves Obamacare. I love Obamacare. My whole thing is we are going to end it. I said to a few people that were watching, I said do people believe this when he says that? It is terrible. It's terrible. And that's why in the Senator he is known as a liar. Marco Rubio, who is a good guy, called him a liar during the debate. Remember that? He said, you are a liar. I said that is great when another Senator can call a Senator a liar. I said I can do it also. So it's great. So we came up with Lyin' Ted. L-Y-I-N, hyphen. But --

(CHEERING)

It's true. It's terrible.

And now he is getting creamed in the polls. He lost the last five elections. He was saying I'm the only one that can beat Donald Trump. I have proven it time and time again. I'm saying, please, I'm killing him. And he said, I won seven times. Remember the debate. I said I won 21 times. And he looked.

(CHEERING)

I won seven times. It is like unbelievable. He is getting clobbered. He goes to New York last week and they ran him out of the place. You can't run if you can't get like 12 percent in New York. You can't run. You just can't. Too big. It's too important. I think I'm going to win New York. I really do. I mean in the general election.

(CHEERING)

And nobody else, honestly, because it is very important that we win. We have to beat Hillary Clinton. Crooked Hillary Clinton. She is crooked.

(CHEERING)

You know, no Republican other than me will campaign in New York. They won't campaign. They are not going to do it because they have no chance. Kasich has no chance, zero. And I understand it. And for years and years, they don't go to New York and campaign. They assume that is lost. If somebody ever won New York it totally, with the Electoral College, totally changes the map. I think we will win New York. I really do. I think we are going to win Michigan.

(CHEERING)

We are going to win Pennsylvania. We are going to win Florida. We are going to win places. Look how well we did in Florida. We are going to win places that a lot of people say you are not going to win, that you can't win, as a Republican, you can't win.

Michigan is a great example. Nobody else will go to Michigan. I'll be encamped in Michigan because I think we can win it. We will win states nobody thought were winnable as a Republican and we'll do really great.

But I love this. The whole political world it is so evil. It's so evil. You hear about people that you never heard of before. It's just like worse than business. Somebody said, what is the difference between these certain politicians because certain politicians are terrific. I spoke to one today, Senator Corker, who is fantastic. We have a lot of great people. Jeff Sessions, Senator Sessions, he is fantastic. And there are others. And you know once we get to the top it's going to be so magnificent. So magnificent. But you saw what happened. So Cruz had this horrible thing. He came in third, meaning he came in last in all of these states. He did horrible, came in last in New York. Then we went to Pennsylvania. We went to all of these people. He went and they said don't come here. And he got ridden out of town and he left. I hate to tell you, he came to Indiana. He might as well come to Indiana because you lose those elections. He came to Indiana and starts lying. That is why I wanted to get here fast. I didn't take a big vacation after winning all five by a landslide. Right?

(CHEERING)

Didn't take a lot of time. I didn't want to take too much time because I know you got him back here lying like hell. I said I better get back to Indiana fast. Get me Bobby Knight really fast, please.

But it is true. I won and people said good, you are going to take a day off. New York is a big state. I went to Syracuse. I went to all over, I went all over the place. And it's the same thing. The businesses are being sucked out of our country. If you look at New York, Indiana, Pennsylvania, all of Maryland. I won Maryland. I won them all. They all have one thing in common. No matter where you go, it's like 40 percent, it's like 50 percent, 60 percent. Jobs are gone. And I'm the one that brings up Carrier all the time. This morning, I hear Cruz. He said and Carrier air conditioning -- I have been talking about this company for four months. All of a sudden, he starts talking about Carrier. Carrier is my baby. I want to do the number on Carrier. I want to do it. I don't like what they did.

(CHEERING)

Cruz was actually defending them, which is interesting. He said we should really defend. You don't want to defend. When they leave, they let go of 1,400 people to move to Mexico. And you know what, they have to pay a consequence when they do that. They have to pay a consequence.

(CHEERING)

They have to pay. They want to move. That's fine. They let them go viciously. Almost like "Apprentice," right? 1,400 people. You're fired! Oh, it's pretty rough. They had some mid-level, upper mid-level management guy, and somebody had the cell phone up. Those are dangerous. But they had the cell phone. And I saw it on television. I thought it was terrible. I thought the way he did it was terribly. Basically said we're debt letting everybody go. You're fired. But we're letting everybody go. Moving to Mexico. Oh, thanks a lot. And some people, they are following me.

Is anybody here from Carrier today? Because they're all over the place? Every place I go.

But what happens, so they let them go and Carrier has to know that if they do that -- I'm not only speaking to them. I'm speaking to Nabisco and Ford and hundreds and hundreds of other companies. They have to know there's consequences when you want to leave and fire all these people and you're not just going to go to another country, make your product, sell it across our really weak borders, because our borders will be so strong, folks. Our borders will be so strong.

SEAN HANNITY: And welcome to beautiful Phoenix, Arizona. We're live with "Hannity " on the road. And for the entire hour tonight, we are joined by 2016 2016 GOP presidential candidate front-runner Donald Trump, as he now makes his way through the crowd.

Ladies and gentlemen, Donald Trump!

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

How are you? Good to see you. Have a seat.

DONALD TRUMP: Thank you.

SEAN HANNITY: Wow! What a...

DONALD TRUMP: That's something, huh?

AUDIENCE: Trump! Trump! Trump! Trump!

SEAN HANNITY: This doesn't get old, does it.

DONALD TRUMP: No. It's amazing.

SEAN HANNITY: You know...

DONALD TRUMP: It's amazing.

SEAN HANNITY: Well, we've got a big election tomorrow...

DONALD TRUMP: Right.

SEAN HANNITY: ... here in Arizona.

DONALD TRUMP: Yes.

SEAN HANNITY: Let's start where we are in the race. You are leading with 678 delegates.

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

This is a winner-take-all state, 58 delegates.

DONALD TRUMP: Right.

SEAN HANNITY: Your next closest competitor has 423.

DONALD TRUMP: Right.

SEAN HANNITY: And John Kasich needs 105 percent of remaining delegates to actually win, which is mathematically impossible.

DONALD TRUMP: I don't know what's going on there, actually. But he's a little behind, yes.

(LAUGHTER)

SEAN HANNITY: Should he stay in the race? Do you think he's staying in the race...

DONALD TRUMP: I don't know. Look, I mean, he's just staying in. He stays in. And you know, Rubio could have done the same thing, could have just stayed in, but he chose not to. I think it was a wise decision. He won't back me. I can tell you that. I can't imagine he backs me.

You know what? If he was smart, he would back me, but he won't back me. Don't forget he was the face of the Republican Party. And then we had an election in Florida. And maybe it's still -- I mean, he's got a great future. Do you think? Right? Rubio? Yes? No?

SEAN HANNITY: Let me -- let's look at...

DONALD TRUMP: I'm trying to be nice. Don't you understand that?

(LAUGHTER)

SEAN HANNITY: OK. That was very good.

DONALD TRUMP: Who knows?

SEAN HANNITY: All right, let's -- let's -- I got a very important question because there's a lot of shenanigans, it seems, going on. Mitt Romney did robocalls for Kasich in Ohio, Rubio in Florida. Now he's supporting Ted Cruz.

And it seems that eve though mathematically, John Kasich doesn't have a path to the nomination, it seems there's an effort to prevent you from getting to 1,237 delegates and that the establishment wants to get to a convention fight on the floor and possibly bypass or disenfranchise voters and put in a consensus candidate.

Now, I don't think they'll get away with it. But what are your thoughts on what you see?

DONALD TRUMP: Well, I think a number of things. Number one, Mitt Romney is a lost soul. I mean, he's just lost. He's going...

(CHEERS)

You know, he ought to sit back. He ought to relax. Somebody said it's the best thing that ever -- I went up 10 points after he did this whole craziness.

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

But he ought to relax. He lost. He had his shot. He choked and he choked very badly and he lost. That was a race that should have been won. That was, frankly, an easier race than this race that's coming up. But I'll win. I will beat Hillary Clinton.

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

SEAN HANNITY: But -- go ahead.

DONALD TRUMP: To answer the rest of the question, though, I mean, there's something going on. You know, they want to -- they want to get it into a convention and then they'll steal it. And if -- you know, I signed the pledge. To me, a pledge means something. They signed the pledge, too. I'm not sure it means very much.

But to me, if it goes to the convention -- and let's say I'm 50 delegates short, all right? If I'm 50 delegates short and somebody else is 500 or 600 delegates short, I don't mind that one as much as somebody else that comes up that maybe got defeated during the process because that's what's going to happen.

So I think that we are going to get there. I think we're going to get there on the delegate count, and let's see what happens. I think it's going to be good.

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

SEAN HANNITY: There's GOP official from North Dakota and the guy's name is Curly Haugland. I want to quote him. He said, "The media's created the perception that voters choose the nominee, but in reality, it's the party that chooses the nominee."

And if that's the case, then why do people...

(BOOS)

Why would people go vote? Why do people caucus? Because...

DONALD TRUMP: Well, I think, you know, what's happening. And I think that probably over the years is what's happened. And one of the reasons I did this -- look, I did this because it's really -- I did it for everybody, but I did it because from my standpoint, I couldn't stand, when I looked at what was happening with Iran, with trade, with our military -- which is being decimated. We can't even beat ISIS -- with our veterans, the way we take care of them, which is nonexistent.

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

And then it turned out that a lot of people felt the same way as I did. I had no idea this was going to happen. You know, it's like a movement. Time magazine did a cover story. It's a movement. And they've actually done four cover stories. But Time magazine has really covered it very accurately. I have to be honest. I was never a huge fan. I'm becoming more and more of a fan, in all fairness.

But it is a movement. And it's an incredible thing. I had no idea this was going to happen. A lot of people in your profession, they say, Did you ever think this was going to happen? And the answer is...

SEAN HANNITY: You're not tying me up with those people, right?

DONALD TRUMP: No, no. But I mean...

(LAUGHTER)

Honestly, both good and bad. I mean, nobody can believe what's going on. And it is something that's very, very special.

And you know, you could call it the silent majority. You can call it the noisy majority. I mean, it's not so silent.

(CHEERS)

It is not so silent, but it is definitely a majority. It's a lot of people.

SEAN HANNITY: Let me read a headline that came out this "week. Anti-Trump groups threaten the largest civil disobedience actions in a century." This is Moveon.org, George Soros money...

(BOOS)

... Black Lives Matter, Bernie Sanders supporters. By the -- I don't know how many of you noticed, in Chicago, Barack Obama's friend, the unrepentant domestic terrorist, Bill Ayers...

UNIDENTIFIED: Should be in jail!

SEAN HANNITY: Agree with you.

UNIDENTIFIED: Should be in a jail!

SEAN HANNITY: He should be in jail. But this is a guy, part of a group that bombed the Pentagon, the Capitol, New York City police headquarters, and Barack Obama started his political career in this man's house. He was a part of what happened in Chicago. You've had disruptions at various events.

DONALD TRUMP: And he may have written the first Barack Obama book, do you think? Do you think?

SEAN HANNITY: There's certainly...

(CROSSTALK)

... in writing style.

DONALD TRUMP: It's a big difference between the first book and the second book.

SEAN HANNITY: The writing style.

DONALD TRUMP: Absolutely.

SEAN HANNITY: A lot of people have said that.

DONALD TRUMP: Absolutely.

SEAN HANNITY: But here's my question. So they're coming at you hard on the left. How do you handle it?

DONALD TRUMP: I'm fine. I mean, you know, look, the rallies...

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

First of all, a lot of this whole thing with, you know, the rallies -- it's a media -- it's a -- it's concocted by the media. My rallies -- like, I had a fantastic rally in Salt Lake City. It was -- it was so beautiful. There wasn't a -- the room was packed. There were thousands of people outside. There was a group of protesters, but it was small, but the media, including FOX, in all fairness -- they made it look like it was a big group. It was a small group.

SEAN HANNITY: It was, like, 20 people.

DONALD TRUMP: It was, like -- you know, if you look at it on television, you'd say, Oh, this is the end of the world. And it's, like, these guys -- and if you interview them, they don't even know why they're there. You know, they don't even know...

(LAUGHTER)

SEAN HANNITY: Why are you here?

DONALD TRUMP: The guy goes, I don't know. I don't really know, but I'm here. I don't -- I don't have any comment, OK? I mean, you have to see these interviews. They don't even know why they're there.

But you have professional disrupters. But if you look at my rallies, other than the one I ended in Chicago, where nobody was hurt -- I did the right thing because there you had a couple of thousand disrupters or protesters, whatever you want to call them, and I had 25,000 people. And we were able to stop a lot of them from coming in -- and I can't (PH) because when I landed, the Secret Service, the police, everybody said this could be a potential problem.

So we get a lot of credit, I think, you know, to end -- I hate to do that. I hate to do that.

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

But the end result -- the end result is nobody was hurt. There was nobody hurt.

But when you see the spirit of these people holding those Trump signs -- these are great people. And you know, the theme is "Make America great again." The one thing they want is make America great again. That's what they want.

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

SEAN HANNITY: I want to take -- I'm just going to talk process, but I want to talk about how we actually do that, the specifics of your plan.

DONALD TRUMP: All right.

SEAN HANNITY: There's a Politico story this week that, you know, says -- they quoted all these left-wing groups, Moveon, NARAL, Greenpeace...

DONALD TRUMP: And they never quote us!

SEAN HANNITY: No, no.

DONALD TRUMP: (INAUDIBLE)

SEAN HANNITY: I quote you. All right. A five-alarm fire for our democracy, a threat to the America we love -- now, you had a little run-in with Hillary earlier, but...

UNIDENTIFIED: Clinton's a war criminal!

SEAN HANNITY: ... if you become the nominee -- it's the same playbook every election year. Republicans are racist, Republicans are sexist, Republicans are anti-gay, Republicans want to poison the air and water and throw your grandmother over a cliff. They'll have a Donald Trump look-alike throwing Granny over the cliff.

DONALD TRUMP: Yes, I know.

SEAN HANNITY: You know what? Republicans in the past have been absolutely impotent in dealing with those attacks. How will you deal with it?

DONALD TRUMP: Well, you have to deal with it very tough and very strong. Now, they came at me about two months ago. They sort of indicated that I was sexist, OK, which I'm absolutely not. I have tremendous respect for women. I have -- I mean, my mother...

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

I mean, between sexist -- they only hit me with the sexist, and the sexist, the racist. I'm the least racist person. Friends of mine that happen to be African-American said, You're the least racist person we've ever met. Give me a break!

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

(CROSSTALK)

All of that's going to come out. The pastors are -- you know, I'm winning all the evangelicals.

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

I mean, Cruz -- Cruz doesn't know what happened. I can't say this in front of Sean, but Lyin' Ted doesn't know what happened. They don't likely liars, you know? They don't like liars. But I mean, he lies. I never met a...

(CROSSTALK)

SEAN HANNITY: ... a shot even at me?

(CROSSTALK)

DONALD TRUMP: I have never met a man that lied like Ted Cruz. I've never met a man that lied so much. And must ask Ben Carson, who, by the way, endorsed me. Isn't that nice?

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

(INAUDIBLE) what he did to Ben, where he said Ben was out of the race in Iowa. Ben is out of the race. And he took those votes. It was disgusting.

But the fact is that they hit me two months ago, and I hit them back very hard and I talked about her husband because, you know, when she calls me sexist -- I mean, who's the number one in the world, right?

(LAUGHTER)

And I hit her back very hard, and there was dead silence from their group. It was dead. And I will tell you I heard they had a very rough weekend. He was saying, Why do you do that? And she's going, Well, I did it. And it's one of those things. And then she looked at him and she was plenty angry, also.

SEAN HANNITY: Yes!

DONALD TRUMP: But...

SEAN HANNITY: You also said...

(CROSSTALK)

DONALD TRUMP: And Bernie got all the credit because that's when Bernie said -- because she went down so much during that one weekend, and Bernie got all the credit. They're saying, Wow, Bernie is now -- it wasn't that he went up. It's just that she went down big that weekend. So let's see.

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

I will tell you -- the one -- I told Chuck Todd. I told Chuck Todd -- he said, Well, I've heard that Hillary wants to run against Donald Trump. I called him. I said, Chuck, let me explain. It's like a chess game, right, high (PH) masters, grand masters. I said, Chuck, when they say they want to run against you, that means they don't want to run against you. Do you understand that? He said, Well, that could be so. That could be so.

Look, I'm not knocking him, I'm just saying the one person that they don't want to run against is me because I'm going to win. And I'm going to bring states in like New York, like Michigan.

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

I'm going to bring -- Sean, I'm going to bring states in that are not in the equation.

SEAN HANNITY: You know, they always talk about...

(CROSSTALK)

... that you had 71 percent.

DONALD TRUMP: Yes.

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

SEAN HANNITY: Another one had you at 65. Let me deal with one other source of opposition to you. There's been all these groups meeting to stop Trump, Sea Island, Georgia, out in California, Erick Erickson had a group. And they -- this is what they said. I'm a conservative. I believe in limited government, free markets and free trade. Donald Trump does not.

Now, I have had...

(BOOS)

No, I have had -- we've done a lot of interviews together, right? We've done a lot of interviews.

DONALD TRUMP: A lot.

SEAN HANNITY: I want to go through the list of things you have told me in these interviews and tell me if you agree.

DONALD TRUMP: OK.

SEAN HANNITY: You are pro-life.

DONALD TRUMP: Yes.

SEAN HANNITY: You are pro-2nd Amendment.

DONALD TRUMP: Yes.

SEAN HANNITY: You -- we know where you stand on immigration.

DONALD TRUMP: Yes.

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

SEAN HANNITY: Until we can vet radical Muslims that would infiltrate the Syrian population, they don't get in.

DONALD TRUMP: You can't.

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

SEAN HANNITY: You said to me you will repeal Obamacare  and replace it with health care savings accounts.

DONALD TRUMP: Correct.

SEAN HANNITY: You also went on to say you will rebuild the military.

DONALD TRUMP: I will. I will totally rebuild.

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

We're going to have a very, very strong military.

SEAN HANNITY: Everybody in Phoenix knows you will fix the broken VA system, especially here.

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

DONALD TRUMP: (INAUDIBLE)

SEAN HANNITY: You have told me in interviews that you will be energy independent.

DONALD TRUMP: Right. Absolutely.

SEAN HANNITY: OK. You have said you will eliminate Common Core and put education back to the states.

DONALD TRUMP: Right.

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

SEAN HANNITY: OK. Now, they made a statement and they said you are not those things. So I want to ask you this. On all of those items I just mentioned...

UNIDENTIFIED: (INAUDIBLE) the wall!

SEAN HANNITY: ... to those people that say, publicly or not, even Ted Cruz, Erick Erickson or any other conservative -- do you say on every issue that you have told me in the past that that is your solemn pledge and your solemn vow that if you become president, you will follow that agenda?

DONALD TRUMP: A hundred percent. Now -- and let me just...

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

A hundred percent. But I have to say, the biggest reason, which is stupidity -- the biggest reason they say I'm not conservative -- and I don't even care about labels. You know, Jeb Bush used to stand up. He is not a conservative. And I'd say, What's wrong with this man?

(LAUGHTER)

By the way, I don't think I'm going to get his endorsement, either. Who cares? But look, the biggest thing that they would say, I'm not a free trader. I am a free trader. The biggest thing. Those things mostly, I think for the most part, right -- I never get really hit on those things.

But one thing -- I want smart trade, not even fair trade, I want smart trade.

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

When we have a trade deficit with China of $505 billion, when we have a trade deficit with -- as an example, with Mexico of $58 billion a year -- trade deficit -- now, they all talk about the wall. You know, we're going to build a wall and Mexico's going to pay for the wall.

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

And everybody -- and, Sean, all of these politicians, they all come up -- first they said, You'll never build a wall. Now the other day, I heard Cruz got up and say, We're going to build a wall. It's, like, you know, where did he come from? My wife heard it. She said, Could you come here? I just -- would you listen to this? She'd never heard it before. But now, all of a sudden, he wants to build a wall.

They don't know how to build a wall. They don't know how to start. You know, they wanted to build a wall 15 years ago. They couldn't get their environmental impact statements approved.

SEAN HANNITY: But I think this is important...

DONALD TRUMP: But Sean, the one thing...

SEAN HANNITY: Yes.

DONALD TRUMP: The reason they're going to pay for the wall -- when we have a trade deficit of 58 -- because they say, You can't get Mexico to pay. By the way, as sure as you're sitting there, as sure as almost everybody -- they have standing room in the back -- but as sure...

UNIDENTIFIED: We love you!

DONALD TRUMP: Yet we -- I love you, too. But here's the thing. When you have a trade deficit, Sean, of -- think of this, Mexico, $58 billion, and you have companies moving in -- Carrier's moving. Nabisco's moving. Ford is -- everybody -- I mean, everybody's moving into Mexico. We're not going to have anything left. Mexico is a small version of China. So -- but here's the thing...

(CROSSTALK)

They don't have to write a check. When you have $58 billion in trade deficits, right, and you have a $10 billion wall -- it's going to cost $10 billion. It's going to be 1,000 -- you don't need 2,000. It's 2,000 miles. You need a thousand because we have natural, you know, barriers. But when you have $10 billion and you have $58 billion, anybody in this audience can figure that one out really easy, OK, really easy.

(APPLAUSE)

SEAN HANNITY: The last -- just to follow up on that last question -- so any time -- because I've interviewed so much and I go on my radio show and then people call in and they repeat what some of the other candidates say or some of these groups say -- and I say, Well, I've interviewed him and this is what he tells me. You're saying this is it. This is your agenda.

DONALD TRUMP: This is it.

SEAN HANNITY: That's your vow.

DONALD TRUMP: That's it. Except with trade.

SEAN HANNITY: Because I...

DONALD TRUMP: Except with trade.

SEAN HANNITY: Then why do they...

DONALD TRUMP: Except with trade.

SEAN HANNITY: Then why do they say...

DONALD TRUMP: Well, they hit me more on trade than anything else.

SEAN HANNITY: Then why do they say you're not a conservative?

DONALD TRUMP: These people, they talk about eminent domain. If you don't have eminent domain, you can't build a road, you can't build a hospital, you can't build a highway.

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

I see these commercials, and I have to tell you -- I have to tell you because there's one group, they're, like, a sick group. They're, like, a sick -- it's called Club for Growth. I never heard of them. I have to tell the story.

So they come -- they're, like, extortionists. They come. And a friend of mine calls up, Could you meet with Club for Growth? I said, What is that? Don't forget I've been in business. I'm not the politician. I've been doing this for eight months.

How'm I doing? Am I don't...

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

I'm doing like you'd be doing. I'm their messenger.

So I get a call from a friend. He wants me to meet with Club for Growth. I say, What's that? It's a conservative group. Oh, do I have to? He said, Please do it as a favor to me.

So this comes up. He was a former congressman -- comes up, asks me for a million dollars. I said, What are you? What do you do? He asked me for a million dollars. Very nicely, I turned him down. Then he writes me a letter, which I have. Turned him down. After that, they do commercial after commercial. If I would have given them a million dollars...

SEAN HANNITY: They'd be your best friend.

DONALD TRUMP: ... -it have been fine, OK? But I'm glad a didn't.

SEAN HANNITY: Can I have a million? No, sorry.

(LAUGHTER)

DONALD TRUMP: You don't need it.

SEAN HANNITY: I don't need -- all right, we'll take a break. We're in beautiful Phoenix, Arizona, as we continue the entire hour with 2016 presidential candidate Donald Trump as "Hannity " on the road continue straight ahead.

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

Welcome back to beautiful Phoenix, Arizona...

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

... "Hannity " on the road, as we continue with 2016 GOP front- runner Donald Trump.

Mr. Trump, let's -- let's talk a little bit about the biggest issue. And Joe Arpaio is going to join us in a few minutes.

DONALD TRUMP: Great guy.

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

SEAN HANNITY: The people of Arizona have been on the front lines of illegal immigration. I have been on the border 10 times. I've been in the drug warehouses. They're massive, filled floor to ceiling. I've been out on horseback. I have been out on all-terrain vehicle and boats, all the way from the Rio Grande to San Diego. I've seen tunnels dug.

It's impacting our criminal justice system, our educational system, our health care system. You have taken a hard-line position.

DONALD TRUMP: Very hard line.

SEAN HANNITY: How -- how long will it take to secure that border?

DONALD TRUMP: I think immediate. I'll tell you what. On Drudge, there's an article about the border agents. They call them border agents. I call them Border Patrol. But regardless, it said they back me 100 percent. I'm the only one that has their back out of all of these...

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

SEAN HANNITY: Right.

DONALD TRUMP: It's the biggest story on Drudge. And -- and when you have guys like Sheriff Joe and Jan -- and they're not allowed to do their job. I mean, I watch Joe all the time. They're always -- you know, they're always questioning him and doing -- they -- they -- they want this -- it's almost like they want this stuff to come in.

You know, when I won New Hampshire, it was an amazing thing. It was an amazing thing. The people of New Hampshire -- you see this beautiful, idyllic setting, this gorgeous place, and beautiful trees and little roadways. And you go to a meeting, and the first thing they talk about is drugs, heroin. And it comes from the southern border.

And I said, You know what? If I win, I'm going to take care of this because -- and it's not only New Hampshire, it's all over the country. And it's here, too. Big league.

(APPLAUSE)

But I said to them, if I win -- and I won in a landslide. The same thing happened in South Carolina. I won in a landslide. They talk about drugs. We're going to stop it. And people like Sheriff Joe, what -- the job he's done, he doesn't get enough credit for the incredible job he's doing.

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

SEAN HANNITY: Yes. In 2014, ICE released a total of 30,558 criminal aliens from its custody. Now, I sat through a briefing in Texas with intelligence officials, border officials. In an eight-year period, 642,000 crimes were committed against Texans by illegal immigrants. And we still don't protect the border.

Is it because...

(SHOUTING)

Is it because the Democrats want a new voting base and Republicans want cheap labor?

DONALD TRUMP: Well, one of the things that I see -- that I find hard to believe, we have hundreds of thousands of people here that are convicted criminals that are illegally in the country. So we have people that have been convicted of crimes...

(SHOUTING)

... that aren't even serving and they're in the country, and they're walking all over the place. And look, it's -- it's lobbies. You have lobbies. You have powerful -- you know, I'm -- I'm self-funding. It's a very big thing.

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

But if you are -- because -- because I don't need -- I don't need any industry (PH). I mean, all these guys are taking care of -- you look at your friend, Ted Cruz, he's totally taken care of by so many different groups. And so many of the other ones -- I mean, now most of them are gone. I don't have to talk about them anymore.

But you look at them -- and these lobbyists are really good. They're really smart. They raised a lot of money for them. They are totally -- they do the wrong thing for the country. By not taking people's money -- I'm not taking their money. They're not giving me -- I have turned down...

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

I -- Jeb Bush had the biggest fund. He had $158 million. If I would have taken money, I would have blown that thing. I would have had five times that amount. And I feel foolish, in a way, not taking it. I'm -- you know, I always say, I mean, Why don't I take it? Guys are saying, I want to put in $10 million. I want to put in $15 million. And I keep saying, No, no, no. And that's different than my life. My whole life has been taking money, OK? (INAUDIBLE)

(LAUGHTER)

And I'm turning down all this money. I feel a little bit foolish. But the fact is, I feel so good about it. And I don't think I get the credit for doing it, if you want to know the truth. I don't think people say...

(SHOUTING)

No, it's true, though.

(APPLAUSE)

When they go to the voting booth -- I mean, I'm probably in for $30 million, $35 million, which is -- isn't very, you know, economical compared to some. Some of these -- think of it. I'm in for $35 million, OK? Other people are in for $150 million. I'm first, and they're in, like, seventh place, right? And they're gone.

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

How good is that? How good is it? Don't you want that for your president? I mean, you know, that kind of thinking. But the same thing with education. I mean, the United States spends more money on education than any country in the world, and yet we're at the bottom of the pack. You have Denmark and Sweden and Norway and China all at the top, and we're at the bottom and yet we spend more money.

So we want to reverse things. It's not even a question always of money. Like the vets. We're going to take care of the vets. And the money that's spent is enormous...

(APPLAUSE)

... but it's all corrupt. It's all incompetent, you know, especially, frankly, in Phoenix. I read more about the Phoenix vet than I do the Veterans...

SEAN HANNITY: The VA.

DONALD TRUMP: ... the Veterans Administration here than anyplace else in the country. So...

SEAN HANNITY: People -- people died waiting...

DONALD TRUMP: No, terrible.

SEAN HANNITY: And they had two...

(SHOUTING)

... two lists, one when they really applied and then the list when they called them a year later. And sometimes, they'd call families and say, Oh, sorry...

(SHOUTING)

... and -- and the vets that were waiting for health care that we, as a country, promised them...

UNIDENTIFIED: Obamacare!

SEAN HANNITY: ... were dying -- you -- waiting for the care that they never got.

DONALD TRUMP: And there are two people that I've been reading about. I don't know if it's true or not, but they look they're very, very guilty, and they can't even get them out.

SEAN HANNITY: Yes.

DONALD TRUMP: They can't even get them out!

SEAN HANNITY: Well, they were fighting to get their bonuses.

All right, we'll take a break. We're in Phoenix, Arizona.

We have Donald Trump, the GOP Republican ont-runner, for the whole hour tonight, right here on "Hannity."

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

All right, welcome back to Phoenix, Arizona and "Hannity " on the road.

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

And we continue for the entire hour with 2016 GOP presidential ont-runner Donald Trump.

So big AIPAC speech. You talked about an agreement imposed by the United Nations, the (PH) America must use its veto power, as it relates to Israel.

DONALD TRUMP: Yes. Well, they're trying to get an agreement that's being forced down Israel's throat. Now, Israel has been hurt enough by our president. Our president has been, I think, the worst thing that's ever happened to Israel. That Iran deal...

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

That Iran deal is such a total disaster. Now the move is that the United Nations is going to make a deal and they're going to force it down both of them.

Number one, deals don't work that way. It can't work that way. It'll never be acceptable, maybe not even to the other side, although it'll probably be an anti-Israel deal, frankly, if it's done by the United Nations. So you can't allow that. And you have to veto that if it ever comes about. I feel very strongly.

UNIDENTIFIED: We've got to (INAUDIBLE)...

SEAN HANNITY: As president, if Israel comes under attack by radical Islamists and you're the president, you will have their back.

DONALD TRUMP: A hundred percent. And not only that...

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

Somewhere buried in that horrible Iran deal -- one of the worst deals I've ever seen, not even between nations, just one of the dumbest deals I've ever seen anytime. But somewhere in that deal, there's a statement, I believe -- and nobody can confirm it, but everybody's talking about it -- that if Iran gets attacked, we're supposed to come to their defense.

(BOOS)

Now (INAUDIBLE) can you believe it?

(BOOS)

OK. Can you believe it? One of the worst deals, one of the dumbest deals I've ever seen. Now...

SEAN HANNITY: Do you know why we made that...

DONALD TRUMP: I don't know, but there is something to that affect in there.

SEAN HANNITY: When we made that deal, they were burning our flag, burning the Israeli flag. They were chanting "Death to America, " and they said the destruction of Israel is non-negotiable.

DONALD TRUMP: Yes.

SEAN HANNITY: And Obama still made the deal!

DONALD TRUMP: We never walked once, and we should have had the prisoners before we started negotiating. We should have said we're not negotiating. Leave the room and double up the sanctions and you would have had the prisoners out years ago. The whole thing is horrible.

And $150 billion, we get nothing. And I'll tell you what, it's going to lead to nuclear proliferation. You look at what's happening with other countries right now, everybody hates the deal. But for Israel, that's probably the most dangerous deal ever signed. It is the most dangerous deal.

SEAN HANNITY: How do we deal, when you look at the Middle East, you have the Iranian-Palestinian conflict, you have Sunnis, you have Shia in Iran, you have the Sunnis in Saudi Arabia. But then you have General el-Sisi who really went out on a limb and took on radical Islamists. But then the Saudis have always been duplicitous. They want to be our friend. They give the Clintons money and other people money. And then on the other hand when they're fighting Iranian backed rebels in Yemen, now they want our support.

DONALD TRUMP: Sure.

SEAN HANNITY: So what do we do to demand that the Saudis once and for all pick a side here?

DONALD TRUMP: OK, are you ready? So Saudi Arabia before the oil crash and now they're still making a fortune but not as much, but they were making $1 billion a day. So we defend Saudi Arabia. And I have many friends from Saudi Arabia, very nice people. They buy my apartments. They rent my space. I have to -- I'm in a different position. I'm always like defending. Same thing with China. I'm always knocking China.

SEAN HANNITY: Do they buy Trump steaks, too?

DONALD TRUMP: They buy everything, OK? But China, I mean, I have the biggest bank in the world is my tenant. I have the Bank of American building in San Francisco with a great partner and we got that from China. So many different things. I don't have anything against the Chinese, even the Saudis. But our leaders are so stupid that we do this. Now, here's the thing. So here's the thing. I really get angry at the leaders. I'm not angry at these other countries. They're taking advantage of people that don't know what they're doing. Saudi Arabia was making $1 billion a day. We defend Saudi Arabia. They wouldn't be there. Remember the first Iraq war, right?

SEAN HANNITY: Kuwait?

DONALD TRUMP: With Kuwait, where the -- they came in and they were coming, the Iraqis coming in, and the Saudis ran. I mean, I just remembered it and we had the marines in the background, and we took care of it. But I'll never forget that scene. Here's the thing. Not knocking Saudi Arabia, only saying this. Iran now has Yemen. They want to take Yemen. They want Yemen because of the long border with Saudi Arabia. They -- last thing.

SEAN HANNITY: They want hegemony in the region.

DONALD TRUMP: They want the oil from Saudi Arabia.

Here's the thing. So we defend Saudi Arabia. Every time there's a problem, we send our ships, we go crazy. We spend a fortune. We get paid peanuts for this. They're making $1 billion a day. I'm not saying don't defend them. I'm saying we have to be reimbursed. We have to be paid when we do this.

SEAN HANNITY: Don't you think, though, that they have purposely manipulated the oil markets to drive American fracking companies out of business and prevent Americans from having jobs? In other words, I have asked you about energy independence. If we tap into our natural gas, our coal resources, our energy and oil resources in ANWR, the 48 states, the west coast, the east coast, the gulf, if we tap into it we don't need any of their oil. Why don't we do that?

DONALD TRUMP: You mentioned one word, "coal." I see in Kentucky where they were so nice to me. Big victory in Kentucky, big victory.

(APPLAUSE)

But you look at West Virginia. You look at Virginia. You look at Ohio where the industry's been wiped out -- clean coal.

Now, we are going to send -- we are sending coal, the coal industry is destroyed. Miners now, it has just been totally destroyed by Obama and by Environmental Protection, by what they have done. What they have done to that industry. And you do have new technology with clean coal and everything else.

So we send our coal to China and they use our coal. They don't clean it. They use our coal. It spews into the air and we're talking about the carbon footprint. Then Obama hops on Air Force One, the 747, goes to Hawaii to play golf. Comes back again and he talks about the carbon footprint.

So here's the story. We have to energize. We've got to let the coal people be coal people. This was a great industry.

SEAN HANNITY: We should make America energy independent.

DONALD TRUMP: We have to make it energy --

SEAN HANNITY: What do you think about -- look, don't you think the Saudis when they give the Clinton Foundation all this money, don't you think bought Hillary's silence even women in Saudi Arabia can't drive, they can't leave a house without a male relative?

DONALD TRUMP: Well, that's a big discussion right now because now they're finding out that Bill would be getting a fortune to make a speech and then all of a sudden lots of positive things happen when she was Secretary of State. And the email scandal is massive scandal where people were sent to prison for doing a tiny fraction of what she did. You look at General Petraeus, what happened to him, what he did was nothing compared to what she did, and they destroyed his life. So you look at it. So it's a very -- it's a very sad situation.

SEAN HANNITY: You keep saying, if she can run.

DONALD TRUMP: I do say this.

SEAN HANNITY: And you've also told me --

DONALD TRUMP: But I have to tell you, you would think that if they would have done something, they would have done it a long time ago. They'll let her go up to the gate and then indict her?

SEAN HANNITY: But if there's a criminal referral and they don't listen to it, you said you would send your attorney general --

DONALD TRUMP: You have to do that. We have a six-year statute of limitations and certainly you have to look at that.

(APPLAUSE)

But you know what it is? First of all, it is a very bad thing what she did for the country, but it's very unfair for so many people that have done so much less and their lives have been destroyed.

SEAN HANNITY: Last question this segment. I don't have a lot of time. Who are people that you can tell us now -- we started out with 17 candidates. Who are people that you would bring into your administration or ask into your administration?

DONALD TRUMP: I know so many politicians. I know so many people in Washington.

SEAN HANNITY: Name names?

DONALD TRUMP: Let me tell you, we have great people, Sean. We have great people. I don't want to talk --

UNIDENTIFIED: Allen West.

DONALD TRUMP: Good man she just said.

SEAN HANNITY: Rudy Giuliani, A.G.?

DONALD TRUMP: Rudy is great. When we comes around, he's great. Bolton is great. There are so many people that I deal with, Walid Phares is great. We have so many people that you see that you know and I know, and many of these people are going to be part, the good ones.

SEAN HANNITY: All right, we've got to take a break. We are in Phoenix, Arizona, with GOP frontrunner Donald Trump. We have a few special guests when we come back as we continue, HANNITY on the road.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

And welcome back to "Hannity." We're in Phoenix, Arizona. Donald Trump joining us for the hour.

(APPLAUSE)

Mr. Trump, you read social media. I see you tweet, I tweet. You see comments. There is a lot of conflict within the Republican Party. You have mentioned you've had conversations with Paul Ryan, Mitch McConnell, and in your last two victory speeches you have talked about pulling the party together. Tell us about those conversations. And tell us how to you bring those people that maybe weren't supporting you, supporting other candidates together to make sure that Hillary does not become the next president?

DONALD TRUMP: And before I do that, I just want to tell you, we're in Arizona and we are going to protect your Second Amendment, OK?

(APPLAUSE)

People are calling me now, Sean, that I haven't even told you about, our so-called establishment, whatever the establishment means. Nobody really even knows if there is an establishment. But they're call me, they want to get on the, they're calling it the Trump train. I don't say that but they call it the Trump train.

But a lot of people are calling me right that people that you're reporting on, people that are knocking me, I turn on the news. I see them knocking me and then they're calling to try and get a buck. You'll see great unity. I really believe that. As soon as I win you're going to see great unity. You're going to see the Republican Party coming together.

And we're seeing already millions and millions, the biggest story worldwide politically speaking the biggest story there is, millions and millions of people, people that have never voted before -- Democrats, independents. They're all coming in.

SEAN HANNITY: I have a figure to back that up. More people have already voted, or almost as many in 2008 and 2012, and there's still 20 contests to go.

DONALD TRUMP: That's right. We're going to do numbers.

(APPLAUSE)

And you know what, we have 20 percent to 25 percent Democrats here. Now, the Republicans in terms of the primaries are up 70 percent, millions and millions of people. The Democrats are down 35 percent because no enthusiasm.

(APPLAUSE)

SEAN HANNITY: You are confident you can bring the party together?

Last question, and we only have 20 seconds. Did Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell indicate that they will work with you in a positive way to solve America's problems?

DONALD TRUMP: They did do that. I hope that's true and they did do that. We'll see what happens. But we have millions of people that want this to happen. And I think it's going to happen. But millions and millions of people -- it's not me, I'm a messenger. They want this to happen.

SEAN HANNITY: Did you have a great time, Phoenix?

(APPLAUSE)

That is all the time we have left to evening. As always, thank you for being with us. We'll see you back here, our regular time, 10:00 Eastern for election results in Arizona and Utah. We'll see you back in New York on Tuesday. Thanks for being with us.
